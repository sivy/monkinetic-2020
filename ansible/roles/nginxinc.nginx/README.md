# Ansible NGINX Role

This role installs NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, the NGINX Amplify agent, or NGINX Unit on your target host.

**Note:** This role is still in active development. There may be unidentified issues and the role variables may change as development continues.

**Deprecation Warnings:**

With the advent of Ansible collections and the release of the [NGINX Core Ansible collection](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-collection-nginx), the decision has been made to split this role into three smaller roles and reduce the overhead of this role:
*   The NGINX Ansible role will keep working as is and be used to install and setup NGINX.
*   **The NGINX configuration functionalities included in this role will be removed in an upcoming release at some stage after December 1st 2020.** There now is a separate role to manage and create NGINX configurations available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config). Any new issues or PRs related to configuring NGINX should be submitted in the new NGINX Config repository. New issues or PRs related to configuring NGINX submitted in this repository will not be worked on.
*   **The NGINX Unit functionalities included in this role will be removed in an upcoming release at some stage after November 1st 2020.** There now is a separate role to install NGINX Unit available [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-unit). Any new issues or PRs related to NGINX Unit should be submitted in the new NGINX Unit repository. New issues or PRs related to NGINX Unit submitted in this repository will not be worked on.

## Requirements

### Ansible

*   This role is developed and tested with [maintained](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#release-status) versions of Ansible. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
*   Instructions on how to install Ansible can be found in the [Ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

### Molecule

*   Molecule `3.x` is used to test the various functionalities of the role.
*   Instructions on how to install Molecule can be found in the [Molecule website](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
