Although I got the web application book for PHP, I&#39;m starting with the online <a href="http://phpbuilder.com/manual/">PHP Manual</a>. It&#39;s probably the best step-by-step guide to a new language I&#39;ve ever seen.

This is also confirming my long-held belief that languages are easy. APIs are hard. PHP is basically a tame perl. Nooooo problem. I bet it&#39;s going to take me a while though to get into the flow with the PHP APIs for things like database manipulation, networking, etc. That&#39;s where the book I picked up will help.
