Title: More Redmonk
layout: post

I&#39;ve added an extension of the [monkinetic weblog](http://redmonk.net) called [More Redmonk](http://redmonk.net/more/).

Right now you&#39;ll find a [Portfolio](http://redmonk.net/more/portfolio) of graphic design, web design, and development work I&#39;ve done, as well as articles that were too long for the weblog. Currently, that means the [SiteLight](http://redmonk.net/more/sitelight) series, which I&#39;m moving over from the weblog. More articles will be coming soon.
