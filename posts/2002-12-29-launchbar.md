As a Christmas present, a friend gave me a license to Objective Development&#39;s <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">Launchbar</a>. This is the coolest little utility on OS X - and I&#39;m even more happy to use it now that they&#39;ve made the file scanning process <i>much</i> faster. Thank you!!
