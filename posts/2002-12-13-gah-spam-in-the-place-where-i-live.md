Title: Gah! Spam in the place where I live...
layout: post

Ack! I think Mail just had an aneurysm and forgot what spam looked like. I had finally switched my junk mail filter to automatic, and for about 2 months it was like a rock. I did not get a single spam in my inbox, and only 2 or 3 false positives.

Suddenly this week I&#39;
m getting messages in my inbox starting with &quot;ADV&quot; (required of commercial email in CA) which should trigger every rule the junk mail filter has. Ack. I may need to reset the junk mail filter and re-train it all over again. Bleagh.
