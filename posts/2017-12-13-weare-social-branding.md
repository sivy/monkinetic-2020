title: WeAre Social Branding
---
The federated social media project [aardwolf](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf) (nee fedibook) is looking for a new name/identity, and one of the options is a name with a great domain: `weare.social` (oops, taken since 2014 - new domains are being purchased). I love the name and it veers away from the "facebook-but-federated" tone of "fedibook".

I decided to play around with an identity idea, so I whipped this up in 20 minutes. Would need a good bit of tweaking and research on finding licensable or open emojis, but :shrug:
