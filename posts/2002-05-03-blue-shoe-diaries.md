I forgot to mention that <a href="http://www.blueshoediaries.com">Blue Shoe Diaries</a> is back up and running after a brief (but too long!) GeoCities-inspired hiatus. Yay Angie! You rock.

BTW, Angie was one of the hip AZBloggers to show up at our <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/1107">AZ-NY Blogger BBQ</a>.
