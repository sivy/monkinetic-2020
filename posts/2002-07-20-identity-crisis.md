Title: Identity Crisis
layout: post

As some of you know, and some of you have figured out, and some are about to discover... I&#39;ve been out of work for about a month now.

This is a situation I&#39;ve never been in before - unjustly terminated from my last job, seeking new employment, and watching our emergency funds account like a hawk. It&#39;s hard to talk about - I&#39;m still learning to hear myself feel about it. (Yes, I know it sounds weird, but that&#39;s the best way to describe it.)

I find I&#39;m having a bit of an identity crisis. When you find that you&#39;re not doing anymore what you were doing, you have to do something else. My identity as a member of the workforce has been shaped by a variety of unique experiences (as has everyone&#39;s) and which of those experiences are going to support the future is hard to judge.

Right now I consider myself a web-focused Java developer.  Or a java-focused web developer. I guess I&#39;m foremost a web developer - the role and title I chose for myself at the beginning of my web-based career 6 years ago. I&#39;ve always considered the &quot;developer&quot; part of my title to be a generic, boundary-crossing descriptor that has a creative bent to it. That creativity inspires both the form and function of the work I try to do.

Perhaps that&#39;s because I have a degree in Graphic Design, and a good eye. Before discovering the web I worked in several design shops. One was an assembly-line beach mag where I put together quarter-page advertisements 8 hours a day. The other was as a production artist for a real Design Studio. There I learned about the creative process from people who had been in design and advertising for 20 years or more.

So here I am, looking for work. I have a chance to develop skills that have gotten rusty, and - in a sense - shape myself for the positions I&#39;m seeking. But the difficulty is - what DO I want to do? What am I willing to do? What am I capable of? The tech market here isn&#39;t exactly jumping. I&#39;ve been brushing up on my servlet skills, b/c most java+web employers around here are looking for that. I applied for a position on an Interaction Design / Human Factors team. Heady stuff. I have a few areas I can pursue... knowing what is the hard part!
