Well, I finally got around to buying a new license to <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>. I&#39;m in planning mode for a new direction of my life, and I figured now was the time to finally spring for it.


Well, I have to say that I am really really glad I did it. I&#39;ve used OO since before version 1, and it&#39;s a great outliner. I haven&#39;t had a good outliner for over a year now, and I realized this morning how much I had missed it. At some point my brain decided that it was going to do its best work in an outliner, and no amount of cajoling could get it to tolerate a text editor, or (heaven forbid) Word.


No, I and my thoughts are once more comfortably ensconced in an outliner, and all is well.
