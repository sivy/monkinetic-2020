Title: "Dave Winer: Earthlink's FeedReader Is Important Like My FeedReader"
layout: post

&gt;The job of a newspaper is to show you what&#39;s new.

Dave Winer is [talking about](http://www.scripting.com/2006/07/14.html#earthlinksFeedReaderIsAnImportantProduct) the &quot;river of news&quot; metaphor again. This is the &quot;all new posts go into one bucket, most recent first&quot; model that Radio Userland, Amphetadesk, and the other first-generation news readers used.

&gt;The first aggregator, the one I wrote in 1999, did. And so did the one that&#39;s in Radio UserLand, and so does the NewsRiver aggregator that&#39;s built into the OPML Editor.

I don&#39;t particularly care for this model, because I have high-priority sources and low-priority sources. There are some feeds that I put in a &quot;Never Ignore&quot; folder in my aggregator (for the record, I use NetNewsWire). I&#39;ll go there before most any other feeds - *even if there are other feeds that have updated more recently*. This is an aspect of feedreading that the &quot;River&quot; doesn&#39;t handle.

When I&#39;ve browsed the &quot;important&quot; feeds, I start mashing the spacebar to jump through all the unread posts, in whatever folder they are. I&#39;m scanning at this rate, and will go through 40 or 50 new posts in about as many seconds, unless one catches my eye. This is the same model as Dave&#39;s river of news.

&gt;You&#39;re not taking advantage of a key capability of the human brain, it scans very quickly as you scroll.

I think that &quot;mash-and-scan&quot; works as well as scroll and scan for me. YMMV.
