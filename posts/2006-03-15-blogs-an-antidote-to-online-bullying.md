Title: "Blogs: an antidote to online bullying?"
layout: post

This BBC article ([Cyber bullies haunt young online](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4805760.stm)) talks about kids in England getting threatening IMs and emails from the &quot;Real Life&quot; bullies at their schools. Maybe I&#39;m off my rocker here, but it makes me wonder what would happen if, whenever this happened, the victim posted the content of the message and the identity of the bully on his/her blog?

Ok, so maybe they&#39;d just get beat up the next day, but if parents and friends had access to this information, then perhaps other social pressures would come into effect?
