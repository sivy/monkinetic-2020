Title: The Ma of Hockey
layout: post

Something poetic on hockey, of all sports...
<blockquote>[via <a href="http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog">Michael McCracken - Weblog</a>] There&#39;s <i>ma</i> in hockey too... It just comes in shorter bursts. (am I missing a point here?) The <i>ma</i> in hockey comes while a pass is on its way, in the lull after a play, or the two seconds of nothing between a goal and the ensuing celebration when noone really knows whether it went in. <p>You can see it in the center&#39;s faces before the puck drops on a faceoff. Most distinctly, you can see it right before a pass gets in place for a one-time shot. The puck&#39;s on its way to the shooter. (In my mind, it&#39;s Alexei Kovalev, but you can use whoever. OK, no Eric Lindros.) He&#39;s got his stick raised, everyone&#39;s looking toward him, but noone can move yet. The pass froze the defensemen, and the goalie can&#39;t see the puck. In that moment, nothing is happening, but everything&#39;s about to. It&#39;s <i>ma</i>, only shorter. (<a href="http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/2002/10/07#blog5">link</a>)</p></blockquote>
