I was asked by Clark Venable, a member of Penn State&#39;s medical center to provide a technical illustration of a software system to be used in a publication for a non-technical audience. After discussing the system with him I worked up a simple layout in OmniGraffle, a diagramming tool from Omni Group. We went back and forth a few times as we worked out the details and Clark expounded on the system&#39;s functionality and I reworked the illustration. After completion, it was decided that the diagram would also be used in an upcoming PowerPoint presentation.
