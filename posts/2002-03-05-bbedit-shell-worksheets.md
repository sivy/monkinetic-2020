Title: BBEdit Shell Worksheets
layout: post

I&#39;d never used <a href="http://developer.apple.com/dev/tools/mpw-tools/">MPW</a>, so when I (almost accidentally) opened up one of <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit.html">BBEdit</a>&#39;s new Shell Worksheets, I was a bit perplexed as  to what I was looking at. It looked like a lot of text - a document - but there were commands in there as well - and the type of document I was looking at suggested that you could do something with them. Indeed, say the instructions - put the cursor at the end of one of the lines containing a shell command, and BBEdit AutoMagically behind the scenes runs the command in a shell, and dumps the output right into your document. OMG. This is... amazing. Hm. Combine this with a command-line xmlrpc client, and strange (and frightening?) things could happen... Muahahaha -)
