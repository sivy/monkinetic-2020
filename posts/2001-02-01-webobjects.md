Title: WebObjects

I took a big step last night toward fulfilling a 5 year dream: to try developing web applications using Apple&#39;s &quot;WebObjects&quot;.

Thanks to <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com">a friend</a> with an extra license to Apple&#39;s Mac OS X Server, which comes with a developer license to WO, I&#39;ve now got Mac OS X Server and WebObjects 4.0.1 installed on my Blue and White g3/350 at home.

After viewing the movies at<br /> http://www.apple.com/iservices/technicaltraining/wofundamentals.html<br />
I had to try this out. And WebObjects is as cool as I had hoped. Very easy to get started, I can see a lot of depth ahead. This is one of those technologies that is fairly easy to get into (if you have the OO background) but offers almost unlimited room for growth and increase in complexity. I&#39;ve already got 2 or 3 ideas I want to try out.

I <i>love</i> this.
