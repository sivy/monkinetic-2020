I went to the public library to day and came back with an armload of books. The Phoenix Library system rocks. My titles:
<ul><li>The Cathedral and the Bazaar (for fun)</li>
<li>Server-based Java Programming (to get a better understanding of how Java handles networking etc)</li>
<li>Enterprise JavaBeans (expanding my horizons some)</li>
<li>The Humane Interface (HCI design, by Jeff Raskin, Mac interface designer)</li>
<li>Mapping Web Sites (information architecture brushup)</li>
</ul>
