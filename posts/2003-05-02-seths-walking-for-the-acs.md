Title: Seth's Walking for the ACS
layout: post

Seth is <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/3051">walking</a> in the American Cancer Society&#39;s Relay for Life on May 30. He wants to raise $400 (he already has over $200 raised - go Seth!) for the walk - if you can help out, it&#39;ll be going to an awesome cause!
