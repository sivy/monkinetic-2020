title: DiSo After 10 years
---
10 years ago: [Will Norris](https://willnorris.com/), [Chris Messina](https://factoryjoe.com/), [Stephen Paul Weber](http://singpolyma.net/) and I launched a little thing called [The DiSo Project](http://diso-project.org/). *DiSo* stood for "distributed social" and at the time was based on [OpenID](http://openid.net/what-is-openid/), [XFN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFN), and blogs (Twitter just launched the year before and wasn't much on our radar).

10 years later, we have [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), [Activity Streams](http://activitystrea.ms/), [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/), [WebMention](https://webmention.net/), and even an [open, decentralized alternative to Twitter](http://joinmastodon.org).

It took longer then we thought it would, but it's happening.
