layout: post

For the last few months, <a href="http://www.macrobyte.net/">Macrobyte</a> has been working on readying <a href="http://conversant.macrobyte.net/">Conversant</a>, their internet groupware application, for release as a &#39;shrinkwrapped&#39; product. Today marks the first release of <a href="http://conversant.macrobyte.net/news/2002/05/21#MSG229">Conversant 1.0b1</a> to <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> and <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a> developers.

If you run a Frontier hosting service, run - do not walk - to <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/about/index.html">this site</a> and read it. Conversant is the most powerful groupware/cms I have worked with. It runs <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">both</a> <a href="http://www.talesofwo.com">sites</a> I manage, and working with Seth and crew is a pleasure. You will be astounded at the services you can easily offer your customers. it even supports <a href="http://tls.macrobyte.net/releases/0.2.4">SSL</a> for those security-minded clients.

If you are a developer looking for an internal platform for your company&#39;s intranet/extranet needs, Conversant is for you. Conversant includes web-based discussion, calendaring, mailing-list integration, a built-in NNTP server, and more. A super-flexible templating system means you can make your content available to users in any number of XML-based formats, plain text, DHTML, or whatever else you can imagine.

If you currently have a site hosted at one of the Frontier-based ISPs, ask your admin to look into Conversant. Check out http://www.free-conversant.com for a taste of what&#39;s available to you on this platform. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

Believe it or not, I don&#39;t work for Macrobyte. -). But I&#39;ve been using Conversant now for over a year, and have been amazed at what I can do with it. Now go on - get outta here - check it out!
