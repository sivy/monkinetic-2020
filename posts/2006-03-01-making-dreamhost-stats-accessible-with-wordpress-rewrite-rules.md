Title: Making Dreamhost stats accessible with Wordpress' rewrite rules
layout: post

I just upgraded this site to Wordpress 2.0.1, and my stats page at Dreamhost stopped working. This happened once before, and I had fixed it, so I had to go Googling for the answer again. Here it is for posterity:

[Making stats accessible with htaccess](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Making_stats_accessible_with_htaccess).

I&#39;ve also added it over at the Wordpress Codex:
