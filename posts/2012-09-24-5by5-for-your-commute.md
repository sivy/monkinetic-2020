Title: 5by5 for your commute
Date: 2012-09-24 08:56

[5by5](http://5by5.tv/) is my new commute jam. I've got 6 or 8 podcasts I listen to on a regular basis. Favorites include [Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu), [Build &amp; Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze), and [The Ihnatko Almanac](http://5by5.tv/ia).

I also listen to [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net)'s [Talk Show](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/) which I still think of as a 5by5 show, even though John's now broadcasting under [Mule](http://www.muleradio.net/)'s banner.

Now that I'm commuting again, podcasts have pretty much supplanted NPR as my go-to drive-time listening material.
