Title: Deliciously Streaming Links
layout: post

A while back, I registered [deliciouslymeta.com](http://deliciouslymeta.com) and setup a simple Wordpress linklog. I posted to it for a while, but it fell out of use.

Lately, I&#39;ve started using the other [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/redmonk) again, as well as sharing links from my [Google Reader account](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/00577831296247389935), and I&#39;ve even started [Digg](http://digg.com/users/redmonk/dugg)-ing (welcome to the 21st century, Ivy). So I *have* been linking things, but it wasn&#39;t going into my linklog. Silly webgeek. I did add sections to my sidebar for my Google shared items and my del.icio.us links, but it seemed a bit of overkill.

So... last week I ran across [Jeremy&#39;s life-streaming script](http://adactio.com/journal/1202/) again, re-read what it did, and decided it might be a nice way to revive ye old linklog without having to, you know, work. So, I spent some time getting it to work without access to <code>fopen</code> and making it read the funky ATOM feed from Google Reader.

You can see the &quot;beta&quot; version of the script at . If it works well for a while, I&#39;ll move it to the home page, add an RSS feed, and re-integrate it into the homepage here.
