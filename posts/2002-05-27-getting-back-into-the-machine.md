Title: Getting back into the machine
layout: post

Long weekend! Jodi&#39;s parents are here, mine were here three weeks ago, and Jim was here last weekend. Still have pics of that to put up.

My head is not really in blogging now, but I want to work on something programmish, so I&#39;m blogging in order to get my head back into the machine. I spend weeks with my head in the machine... over a long weekend I tend to finally surface.

This is usually a good thing, but right now I have some time to work, and I need to be back inside. <i>Time to plug back in</i>.
