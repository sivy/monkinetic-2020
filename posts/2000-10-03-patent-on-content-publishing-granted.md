Title: Patent on Content Publishing granted
layout: post

<a href="www.emedicine.com">eMedicine</a> has been granted a patent on an <a href="http://www.infotoday.com/it/oct00/news14.htm">internet-based publishing system</a>.  This is not good. I wonder how big the CMS company will have to be to get slapped with licensing or a cease-and-desist letter? <a href="http://www.vignette.com/">This big</a>? <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">This big</a>? <a href="http://www.macrobyte.net/conversant/">This big</a>?
