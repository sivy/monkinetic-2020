Title: Akwa IRC client
layout: post

Seeing as I&#39;m hanging out in #openacs a lot these days, I wanted a better IRC client than <a href="http://www.snak.com/">Snak</a>. Snak&#39;s ok and all, but it&#39;s Carbon and it shows. I found a new client that seems to be very much a Cocoa app, with most of the features you expect from an IRC client: <a href="http://akwairc.online.fr/akwairc.html ">Akwa</a>.
