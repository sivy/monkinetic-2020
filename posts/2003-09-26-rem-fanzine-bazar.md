Title: R.E.M. Fanzine BAZAR
layout: post

The Italian R.E.M. fanzine, BAZAR, has <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/remfanzine/bootinfo.html">a list</a> of what I believe to be various bootlegs, rare tracks, and duets done by R.E.M. and/or Michael Stipe (lead singer) with other artists.

I&#39;ve tracked down a couple of them so far, including Michael Stipe and Radiohead performing R.E.M.&#39;s <a href="http://www.retroweb.com/rem/lyrics/song_EbowTheLetter.html">E-Bow The Letter</a> from <u>New Adventures in Hi Fi</u>.
