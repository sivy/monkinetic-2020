layout: post

<a href="http://www.macfixit.com">MacFixit</a> posts a list of <a href="http://macfixit.pair.com/extras/expoeventssf2001.shtml">products</a> that are being announced/shown at MacWorld.

Of Note:

&quot;<a href="http://www.chronosnet.com">Chronos</a> will show StickyBrain, a new product written specifically for Mac OS X . A classic version for PowerPC Macs running OS 8.1 or above will also be available. &#39;StickyBrain is a personal productivity application that...helps users organize all of the miscellaneous information that clutters their lives and desktops.&#39; &quot; -- I have to see this...

&quot;Connectix will show DoubleTalk, a new utility that allows Macs to connect to PC networks and printers within the &#39;familiar Mac interface.&#39; -- Cool.

7 days to go!
