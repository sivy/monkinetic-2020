Title: Dear Google, somebody got some 'splainin' to do
layout: post

[<b>Correction</b> 10/20/03 2:21 MST] Ok, Dave sent me an email pointing out that that page on Google is &copy; Google, and it points out that the page has been modified by Google from the ODP listing.

Sure enough, <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a> is listed on the <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Weblogs/Tools/Publishers/">ODP page</a>. <i>Well hmmm!</i>

Brian Carnell (<a href="http://brian.carnell.com/4734">alerted</a> by Seth) points out that <a href="http://brian.carnell.com/articles/2003/10/000017.html">Google may be using PageRank</a> to further filter the ODP listing, but that doesn&#39;t really explain Radio&#39;s absence in Google&#39;s listing, since Radio Userland has a substantial PageRank itself (#5 in a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=radio&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Google search for &quot;Radio&quot;</a>).

My apologies to Dave.

[<b>Update</b> 10/20/03 10:47 MST] If Dave took half a sec to <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Weblogs/Tools/Publishers/">look at the bottom of this page</a>, he&#39;d see that Google&#39;s directory is built directly on top of the <a href="http://dmoz.org/about.html">Open Directory Project</a>, where he could probably even <a href="http://dmoz.org/cgi-bin/apply.cgi?where=Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Weblogs/Tools/Publishers">become an editor</a> of the section he&#39;s grousing about if he tried.

Just because the ODP is not built to <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/10/20#howToDecentralizeDirectories">Dave&#39;s specs</a> doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s neither decentralized nor open.
