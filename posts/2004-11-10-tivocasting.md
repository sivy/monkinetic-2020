Title: TiVoCasting?
layout: post

I&#39;m listening to the BloggerCon podcasting session from ITConversations, and they&#39;re talking about devices that can be used to listen to <a href="http://ipodder.org/whatIsPodcasting">podcasts</a>.

You guessed it, when I work at home I listen to my podcasts on my TiVo (via the TiVo Desktop software). The TiVo, dangit, has a great interface for finding and recording content. I&#39;d love to be able to setup a <a href="http://www.tivo.com/1.2.2.asp">WishList</a> that automatically downloads podcasts that match my keyword, participant, or producer search.
