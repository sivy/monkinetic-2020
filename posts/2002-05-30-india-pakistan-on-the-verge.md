Title: India, Pakistan on the verge
layout: post

While the rest of the world hunts <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/alqaeda.html">terrorists</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">monopolists</a>, India and Pakistan have had it up to their earlobes with each other and are amassing, well, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0524-01.htm">masses of soldiers</a> on the 2000 mile border between the two nations.

Then there&#39;s this:
<blockquote>Both armies are modernizing fast: ... their compulsive rivalry is buying them new combat aircraft, new airborne warning and control systems and missiles, new tanks, new artillery.</blockquote>

And this doesn&#39;t include the nuclear option, if it can be called that.

I have to admit that this situation has me worried. A nuclear conflict anywhere in the world is going to have a global effect, and some are <a href="http://www.newsminute.com/pakindianukewar.htm">predicting</a> that a nuclear event on the Indian subcontinent would result in <i>9-12 million people dead</i>. I cannot comprehend that level of destruction. To compare: in 1945, the last time nuclear weapons were used in wartime, the death toll from Nagasaki and Hiroshima was <a href="http://www.airpowermuseum.org/trafter.html">240,000</a>.
