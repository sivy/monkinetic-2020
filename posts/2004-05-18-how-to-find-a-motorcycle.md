Title: How to find a motorcycle?
layout: post

I&#39;m looking for (researching, really) a 600cc motorcycle in the Phoenix area. I really like the Honda Shadow VLX, but they seem hard to come by. I&#39;d rather not spend much - part of my motivation is the high cost of gasoline in the valley right now, and if I can get the bike without getting rid of my truck that would be best.

So far I&#39;ve looked at <a href="http://cycletrader.com">Cycle Trader</a> and <a href="http://motorcycleshopper.com">Motorcycleshopper.com</a>, and tried the local classified sites. Anyone have any other ideas on good places to look for a used bike?
