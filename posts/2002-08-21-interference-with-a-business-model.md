Title: Interference With A Business Model
layout: post

Mark Pilgrim points to Bruce Schneier&#39;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/16.html#interference_with_a_business_model">latest article</a> on the entertainment industry. It contains this pithy bit: &quot;They&#39;re trying to invent a new crime: interference with a business model.&quot;

I recently borrowed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312209630/qid=1029868295/sr=1-17/ref=sr_1_17/102-7707885-8624960">The Years Best Science Fiction</a> (16th Annual Collection - 1998) from a friend, and it had an eerily precient story in it (isn&#39;t that what sci-fi is about?). The story &quot;Halfway House At The Heart Of Darkness&quot; involves a young woman who is a virtual reality addict, being trucked across coun try in a mobile detox van by a counselor trying to help her get &quot;clean&quot;. Why are they traveling across country?
<blockquote>&quot;We are on the run, Keel Benning. You have not been following the news, being otherwise occupied, but companies like your beloved Virtvana have won a major legislative battle. they are now empowered to maintain their customer base agggresively. I believe the wording is &#39;protecting their customer assets against invasive alienation by third-party services.&#39; Virtvana can come and get you.&quot;</blockquote>

William Browning Spencer, &quot;The Halfway House At The Heart Of Darkness&quot;, 1998.
