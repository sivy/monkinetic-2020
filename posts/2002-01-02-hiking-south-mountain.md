Title: Hiking South Mountain
layout: post

Jodi, Kenda and I hiked South Mountain Park for 45 minutes or so this afternoon. The park was packed, but the sun was out and it was pleasant. Jodi managed to put a scratch on our brand-spanking-new 2002 Honda Civic EX :-( when parking (parallel parking next to a rock). Oh well, one of us was bound to do it eventually.
