Title: Papa got a brand new... Newton.
layout: post

Yes, Clark <a href="http://www.romanvenable.net/index/channel/newton/2003/02/23#item277">got hisself</a> a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=3731&amp;item=3008475858&amp;rd=1">brand new toy</a>. Boy am I jealous. No, I don&#39;t have a purpose for it. No, I never used the one I have (a 120) enough. No, I could not afford it, even at the low price he paid for it.

But dzang, every Mac-head should own a piece of history like that. (To go with our Mac Plus, Powerbook 5300, Newton 120, and NeXT Turbo Station -) )
