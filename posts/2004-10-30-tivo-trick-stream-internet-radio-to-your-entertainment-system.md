Title: "TiVo Trick: Stream internet radio to your entertainment system?"
layout: post

Working from home today, and listening to some nice european trance in the background... through my entertainment system. How?

1. Find a nice internet radio stream in [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes)
2. Add the stream to a playlist. This is generally not useful, as the stream never &quot;ends&quot;, so your playlist will never go to the &quot;next&quot; song. Be patient.
3. Install the [TiVo Desktop software](http://www.tivo.com/4.9.4.1.asp) on your Mac.
4. Use the TiVo Desktop preference pane to tell your Mac to share your internet radio playlist.
5. In the TiVo, go to Music and Photos &gt; (your computer) &gt; (your playlist) &gt; (your stream)
6. Play!
