&gt;Here is my third try at a video today this morning. *sigh*. It&#39;s hard to wake up and think of something interesting to sign. :-)

&gt;OK. Last night Jodi and I watched Through Deaf Eyes again in class. We finished the movie. I wrote a paper and posted (sent) it on [my website](http://redmonk.net/archives/2007/04/04/through-deaf-eyes-a-reaction-in-three-acts/). Read it, I hope you like the paper. It called &quot;Through Deaf Eyes: A Reaction In Three Acts&quot; [title]. Please read it, and tell me what you think.
