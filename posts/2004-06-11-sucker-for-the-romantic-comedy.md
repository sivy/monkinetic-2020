Title: Sucker for the romantic comedy
layout: post

I know, I know. I go into the video store and I can&#39;t stomach all the romantic comedies on the shelves. And yet... *<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0128853/">You&#39;ve Got Mail</a>* comes on TV and I&#39;m sucked into the perky, quasi-intelligent-sounding, annoyingly cute language and plot-lines tailor-made to tug on my heart strings and leave me with that awful feeling that my life will never feel that good.

*Sigh*. Pass the ice-cream.
