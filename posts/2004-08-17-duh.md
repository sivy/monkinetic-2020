Dave <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/08/14#When:3:25:43PM" title="Duh!">writes about</a> what I&#39;ve always thought was a good idea but have a serious reason to care about now: we want to be able to subscribe to audio content feeds via something like <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication/Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> and get it downloaded directly to our <a href="http://apple.com/ipod">iPods</a>. I&#39;d love to be able to have |NetNewsWire| automatically add any .mp3 <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt">enclosures</a> to a  special playlist in <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>.
