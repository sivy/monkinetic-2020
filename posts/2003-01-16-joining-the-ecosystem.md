Title: Joining the Ecosystem
layout: post

Via my (rather pitiful) <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&amp;url=www.redmonk.net%2Fmonkinetic">Technorati results</a>, I discovered that my recent spate of posts and my re-addition of my blogroll to the template has got me on the <a href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/ecosystem/">Blogging Ecosystem</a> list. I&#39;m at the bottom (48 outward bound links) but perhaps if I keep this up I&#39;ll move higher. -)
