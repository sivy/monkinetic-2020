Hanging out again today at the Coffee Rush, working on their free (as in beer smile ) wireless network. Met another Mac OS X user here, Jay Jacobson, who started <a href="http://www.xusers.org">XUsers</a>, the local Mac OS X user group. Coffee Rush is also where they meet every month. Sweeeet. Hoping to make it to their next meeting (next Wednesday).
