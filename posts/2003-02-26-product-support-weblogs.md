Title: Product Support weblogs
layout: post

I just finished sending an email to a product support manager for a prominent Mac OS X application developer on the topic of weblogs for product support and community management. He had never thought of starting a weblog for that purpose and had some questions about what he&#39;d post and how useful it would be.

I&#39;d like to have a bunch of links I can send him to weblogs that are being used to support products or application development in the OS X arena. If you are running a weblog as part of your product support/community management, would you <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">drop me a line</a> and tell me about it? If you&#39;re a discussion group kind of person you can <a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;&lt;!--#msgnum--&gt;/reply">respond there</a> too. At some point I may go so far as to write up an article on the topic.

I really think that weblogs in this area are an under-utilized resource, and we&#39;re going to be seeing more of them in the future.
