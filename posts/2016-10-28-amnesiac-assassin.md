<p>You know, the one where they slowly get their memories back, and drag some poor nearly helpless sidekick around while killing bad guys and making things right?</p>

<p>Yeah, it was the best!</p>

No, not [that one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/). Not [that one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/) either, or [that one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440963/).

No, [THIS ONE, the Long Kiss Goodnight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116908/). Greatest amnesiac assassin move ever. Geena F'ing Davis is the one-time assassin, and Samuel L. Jackson the nearly helpless (but not completely hopeless) private eye getting dragged all over, getting shot at and screaming a lot.
