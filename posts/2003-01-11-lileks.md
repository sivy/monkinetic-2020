(What is it with the no-RSS-feed thing? Silly web site editor, expecting me to use a web browser! -))

But seriously, I recently discovered <a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/">James Lileks</a> after Msr. Cadenhead <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2003/01/09.html#a488">trounced him</a> for being a meanie. (On the other hand, he did also call him amusing and brilliant).

Check Lileks out - he&#39;s funny - very funny. And right on in many ways.

Hm, I&#39;m going to need a Politics category. Oh wait, there it is. Nevermind.
