Title: "LazyWeb: SMBMeta + GeoURL"
layout: post

Ok, I&#39;m interested in this and don&#39;t have the time to work on it, so I&#39;m going to try invoking the mystical power of the <a href="http://iawiki.net/LazyWeb">LazyWeb</a> to get it done:

The idea is that someone creates an XML namespace for geoURL data with a couple elements that can be added to an <a href="http://www.smbmeta.org">SMBMeta</a> file (see mine <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/smbmeta.xml">here</a>). Although the SMBMeta format already has location and address information, GeoURL info would be kinda cool too.

*update*: Dan wrote to say that enough people have mentioned this that they&#39;re likely to add a &lt;coordinates&gt; field to SMBMeta. &lt;mr burns&gt;EEeexceellent&lt;/mr burns&gt;.
