Title: Morning Coffee Notes
layout: post

Ok, I&#39;m on my second cup already because I got distracted. After noticing Scoble&#39;s <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/03/03.html#a2417">link</a> to Joel on Software, I decided to read Joel&#39;s most recent email article, on Building Communities with Software. It got me thinking about how the <a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/">forum</a> on this site works. I may make some changes around here but I&#39;m not sure yet.

Then I linked over to Jeff Veen&#39;s site and discovered he has a <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">weblog</a> and <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/rss.xml">an RSS feed</a>. Subscribe. Read last n posts. Yummmy!

Yesterday I found out that a good friend was in a &quot;gnarly&quot; (his word) car wreck, and spent some time in an ER trauma room. I heard second-hand that he was released some hours later, and is at a friend&#39;s place recovering. Thank God! I remember driving a Subaru Brat into a 5&#39; deep ditch (and several trees) at 45 mph when I was 19... I walked away from it but it scared the bejeezus out of me. Get better soon, Anthony!

Hm. I recenlty subscribed to John Lawlor&#39;s <a href="http://www.blogs4business.com/">Blogs4Business</a>, um, blog. John seems to teeter on the edge of &quot;marketing drivel&quot;, while still having some good stuff to say. Luckily he doesn&#39;t post <i>too</i> often, as reading a blog about the wonders of blogging can get redundant, fast.

Noticed Adam&#39;s link to <a href="http://blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2003/03/04.html#a3223">Dave&#39;s audblog post</a>, so I thought I&#39;d <a href="http://www.audblog.com/media/2008/11109.mp3">try it out</a>. I didn&#39;t realize that the trial post was only foor one minute, so I got cut off. :( (Warning: that post is the sound of the only-barely-caffeinated-Steve.) I think if I had a cellphone and lived somewhere where interesting things happened, I might subscribe. Oh, and if I had a job, so all this talk of paying for things was more than academic. -)
