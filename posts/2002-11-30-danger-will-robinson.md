Title: Danger Will Robinson!

Jodi and I were out at Chandler Fashion Center tonight, hanging at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/thanksgiving/">Apple Store Thanksgiving Event</a> (&quot;Come on baby, mommy needs a brand new iMac!&quot;) and we stopped at the T-Mobile store to look at the <a href="http://danger.com/">Danger HipTop</a> (Sidekick).

That is one slick device. It&#39;s $200, and the unlimited data + some phone time service plan is only $39/mo. If it weren&#39;t for that pesky unemployed thing...

Seriously, it got me thinking about doing a browser-detected version of this weblog for Danger devices - black and white, single column. I tried out the browser there in the store, and it&#39;s pretty good.
