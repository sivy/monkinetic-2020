Title: Macromedia MX
layout: post

Looks like <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia</a> has got their whole lineup out in the new MX form now. I know <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106884/2002/04/29.html#a2">Dreamweaver now runs on OS X</a> (that link also has all the other areas that were improved in MX).

<i>Update</i>: Dreamweaver and Fireworks MX are in preview now - they&#39;e not shipping them yet. You can download trial versions however.
