Title: Notice of Revocation of Independence
layout: post

Duncan Smeed has <a href="http://www.smeed.org/2000/11/16">a copy of a hysterical email</a> that&#39;s been going around.

<i>The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays &quot;American&quot; football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.</i>

<i>..You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde.</i>
