Title: Safari Beta 2 released, becomes default browser of monkinetic weblog
layout: post

<b>April 14, 2003, Gilbert, AZ</b>: Apple released the second beta today of its new <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> web browser, bringing on new features and a &quot;proper&quot; implementation of tabs.

&quot;I can use Safari now as the web browser of choice for monkinetic, since Apple got their tabs act together&quot;, says Steve Ivy of the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">monkinetic weblog</a>. &quot;Following a link in NetNewsWire causes a new tab to be opened in Safari (with the appropriate preference selected). This is what Mac OS X-using webloggers have been waiting for.&quot;

&quot;Safari&#39;s page rendering capabilities are impressive, and are getting even better with this new release. I imagine that the other Steve [ed. Jobs, the mercurial CEO of Apple Computer, well known for his refined taste and penchant for abusing employees] has been pushing his guys pretty hard lately.&quot;

Mr. Jobs could not be reached for comment.

Apple started the personal computer revolution in 1971. Steve Ivy of the monkinetic weblog was born in 1971. Coincidence? We didn&#39;t think so.
