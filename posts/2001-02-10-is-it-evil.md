Title: Is it evil?
layout: post

From the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/02/09">I Still Don&#39;t Get It Department</a>. Why does a leader of the commercial software community write <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">software</a>, the source for whose internals is largely available? What if I modify his software to suit my own purposes and break it? Following the logic of commercial software, wouldn&#39;t the software be better if it was in a black box? Is his software non-proprietary? Open source? Evil? Questions questions questions. I have so many questions.

<i>Maybe we all don&#39;t fit in boxes.</i>
