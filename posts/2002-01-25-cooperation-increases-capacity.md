layout: post

David P. Reed is <a href="http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_01_20_archive.html#8971522">discussing</a> some fundemental questions about the process of dividing up the radio spectrum to provide &quot;non-interference&quot; between electromagnetic devices.<p>
As is often the case, this great quote applies simultanously to technology and human behavior:<p>
<i>And the basic question of the limits on &quot;spectrum capacity&quot;, as a scientific question, is slowly developing answers - surprising ones. It turns out that network cooperation increases capacity.</i></p></p>
