Title: "Brent on ST:Enterprise"
layout: post

Brent Simmons <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/07/13.html">posts his thoughts</a> on Star Trek series V - <a href="http://www.startrek.com/production/seriesv/default.asp">Enterprise</a>. He&#39;s coming from the same angle I am. I&#39;m so excited about this, I&#39;m working on reviving an old tradition among my friends of getting together weekly to watch Star Trek. <p>

When it was 1993-4, and <a href="http://www.startrek.com/library/episodes_tng.asp">ST:TNG</a> was the shit, we gathered religiously on Thursday nights. I was never too impresed with ST:Deep Space Nine, or ST:Voyager. They were too much like soap operas, and too easy. <p>

Brent says it right: <i>The 24th Century is all played out -- it got to the point where any problem could be solved by reversing the polarity of the quantum phase-shift generators (or whatever).</i><p>

If any of the Anomalies are out there - I miss you guys.</p></p></p>
