Title: Doctorow gunning to get life imitating art
layout: post

It seems to me that [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com) is working a little *too* hard to make [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom](http://craphound.com/?p=147), his work of science fiction set in a world where the artists and geeks of Disney World have taken over operation of the park in a sort of anarchistic revolution - come true. At least, for some virtual version of &quot;true&quot;, as realized in the huge virtual world of [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/). From [Rough Type](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/11/the_dingo_stole.php):

>Meanwhile, outside agitator Cory Doctorow, of Boing Boing, raised the specter of an outright revolution in which residents would seize control of Second Life from Linden Lab. &quot;Second Life&#39;s management is doing an exemplary job of coping with this,&quot; wrote Doctorow, &quot;but benevolent dictatorships aren&#39;t the same thing as democracies. If a game is going to declare that its players are citizens who own property, can the company go on &#39;owning&#39; the game?&quot;
