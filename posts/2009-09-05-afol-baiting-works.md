Title: AFOL baiting works
layout: post

If whoever wrote up the description of then new (and AWESOME) LEGO Town [Fire Brigade](http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=10197) set isn't totally baiting the [AFOL](http://www.brickspace.org/2009/03/brickspace-dictionary-afol.html "Adult Fan Of LEGO") crowd, I'm a monkey's uncle:

>Fire Brigade features rare LEGO elements including bricks and plates in dark tan, 1x1 dark red tiles, a red hot dog and the 3x6x5 Belleville&reg; arch. It also features gold fireman's helmets, a tan hand bag and a red sliding garage door!

Of course, *I want it I want it oh I want it*.
