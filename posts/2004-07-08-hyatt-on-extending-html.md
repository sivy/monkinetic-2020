Title: Hyatt on Extending HTML
layout: post

A week ago <a href="http://redmonk.net/2004/07/01/safari-13-search-field">I commented</a> that I wasn&#39;t sure about the way Apple was extending HTML in Safari 1.3/2.0. Quite a few others brought up the same point, notably <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/05/SafariExt">Tim Bray</a> (author of the XML spec).

Today Dave <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005928">responds</a>
 to some of the suggestions/complaints he got over it. I don&#39;t necessarily like the approach they&#39;ve taken, but I must admit I like the features, and I don&#39;t really see a better way to both get the features *and* get vendor cooperation on implementing them in a semi-standard way.
