I&#39;m headed up north to Flagstaff today with a friend of mine - he&#39;s getting the final piece of a set of tatoos that cover his whole upper right arm. Dustin is, literally now, a &quot;piece of work&quot;. -)

Jodi made the inadvertent mistake of asking me the other day if I would ever get a tattoo... I&#39;ve thought about it quite often, and could never think of what I&#39;d want to carry around permanently. Of course, hanging out in a tattoo parlor may give me some ideas... -)
