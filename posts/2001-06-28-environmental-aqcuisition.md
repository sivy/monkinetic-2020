Title: Environmental Aqcuisition
layout: post

<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/421">Tim O&#39;Reilly</a> points to a <a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=705/BYT20010614S0001/index.htm">Jon Udell article</a> on &quot;Environmental Aqcuisition&quot;: a fancy name for hierarchy-based inheritance.<p>

<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>, the scripting system I used for many years, had this concept in it&#39;s web site framework back in 1995: directives defined at higher levels of the container hierarchy were inherited by lower levels unless explicitly overidden.</p>
