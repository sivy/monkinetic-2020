*Sigh*. Network Solutions is now <a href="http://public.wsj.com/sn/y/SB982282009562632162.html">selling all the information in the whois database</a> to direct marketers. If you&#39;ve ever registered a domain name, direct marketers will now be able to target you based on any information you&#39;ve entered in the registration database, as well as how long your site has been up, if you&#39;re doing ecommerce, if your domain is active or not... damn.
