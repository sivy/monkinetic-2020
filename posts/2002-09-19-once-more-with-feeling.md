Title: Once more, with feeling
layout: post

Well, I think I&#39;ve beaten back most of the bugs I introduced while &quot;upgrading&quot; Sid to Apple&#39;s new web services API. I should have known to keep a working copy of Sid around. Oy.

Thankfully, while fixing things up I was able to refactor some of the cruftier parts of Sid, while adding some decent interface improvements. The history can now be cleared (who needs 100 past messages? They&#39;re on the site, silly.)

I&#39;m not quite ready to &quot;release&quot;, but if you&#39;re running a Conversant site and want to fool with it, <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net?subject=Interest in Sid">let me know</a>.
