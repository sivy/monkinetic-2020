Title: Happy Birthday to Jodi, Early
layout: post

Well, after a month of planning behind her back, I managed to pull off a (very nearly heart-stopping) surprise party for Jodi last night. Tomorrow is her actual birthday, but I had to do it early to get the most people here and to make sure she did not make other plans. With the collusion of a few friends in our church, I handed out invitations, arranged for a large cake, balloons, streamers, 30 guests, snacks, ice cream...

Jodi, after going out on an innocent (snicker) shopping trip with one of my co-consipirators, came home to a living room full of friends and family shouting &quot;surprise!!!&quot;

The best part: she&#39;d been telling a few friends how she had really been hoping for a party this year but that I wasn&#39;t really good at remembering or planning these things and that how she was disappointed that she wouldn&#39;t get a party...

Cake, $15. Balloons, $4. Candles, $4. Phone calls to friends and family, $2. The flabbergasted dumb-struck look on Jodi&#39;s face when we surprised her:

Priceless. smile
