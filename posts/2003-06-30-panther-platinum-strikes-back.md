Title: "Panther: Platinum strikes back"

I saw <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000243.php">this OmniWeb 4.5 screenshot</a> on <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">Jason Friedman&#39;s site</a>, and couldn&#39;t help but think of Mac OS 9&#39;s Platinum appearance. I wonder if this is an OS X theme, or is it the new Panther UI? Looks like a &quot;Platinized&quot; Aqua...
