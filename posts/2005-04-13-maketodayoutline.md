I&#39;m just beginning to work on my own <acronym title="Getting Things Done">GTD</acronym> system, and I&#39;m using OmniOutliner 3 Pro for a good part of my action list management. Since David (Allen, author of ::amazon(&quot;0142000280/merlinsblog-20&quot;,&quot;Getting Things Done&quot;)::) recommends using your calendar to manage the hard landscape, I have appointments and such in iCal.

Today I wrote a short AppleScript that pulls today&#39;s appointments from iCal into an OmniOutliner document called Today.oo3, stored (by default) in ~/GTD/. It&#39;s nothing fancy, and I&#39;d be open to suggestions if anyone tries it and has ideas.

The script can be found here:

Bugs: for some odd reason, the script may grab all-day events from the next day.

Next action: add a column for the time of the event.
