God. I haven&#39;t enough breath to say how many things are wrong with <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/21577.html">this proposed digital rights management bill</a>. This is not digital rights mangement. It&#39;s digital rights removal. As content moves to digital formats, media companies are finding that software/hardware can make it possible for them to absolutely control how &quot;their&quot; content is used, viewed, etc. No more pesky &quot;fair use&quot; (in current copyright law). The software is creating law. The DMCA basically says, &quot;any restriction we can put on you in the software is legal&quot;. This upcoming bill is worse. Say goodbye to taping your favorite tv-shows. Say goodbye to ripping you cds to mp3. Say goodbye to lending that book from the Library (themselves sure to be illegal soon) to a friend. The Communist states could only dream of having so much control over the information to which their subjects had access.
