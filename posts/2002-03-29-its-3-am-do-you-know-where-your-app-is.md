Title: It's 3 AM. Do you know where your app is?
layout: post

It <i>is</i> 3 AM, and I&#39;m on the upstairs couch at work, trying to relax and eventually get some sleep. My app has (finally) been online for 30 minutes, and I feel like a nervous father watching his kid ride a bike for the first time. In traffic. At the Indy 500. (!)
