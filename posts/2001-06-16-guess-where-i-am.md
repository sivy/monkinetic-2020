Steve here, coming at you from the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/">Apple Store</a> in Tyson&#39;s Corner, Virginia. (Posting from a TiBook over Airport - drool drool drool) <p>

We saw <a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2</a> last night  (who rocked the house for 25,000 people), and today came out to McLean to check out the Apple Store. Talk about packin&#39; in the fun!!</p>
