Title: NetStruxr frameworks release 2
layout: post

NetStruxr has put out a new release of their excellent WebObjects 4.5 frameworks.<p>

Patrice Gautier on the WebObjects-Dev mailing list:<br />

&quot;For this release, both ERExtensions and ERDirectToWeb have received massive
attention, both in the way of quality and quantity. Documentation is still
very much wanting, but that hasn&#39;t stopped us in the past!&quot;<p>

NetStruxr&#39;s code is great - reading it over is a great elarning experience for any WO programmer. Check it out <a href="http://www.netstruxr.com/developer/">here</a>.</p></p>
