Title: A Day Without &quot;Get&quot;
layout: post

Perusing &quot;Seth&quot;&#39;s older posts, I stumbled on <a href="http://truerwords.free-conversant.com/2000/11/08#TW389">this one</a>, on the overuse/misuse of the word &quot;get&quot; in American English vernacular. Hmmm. Conciously changing one&#39;s speaking patterns must be (notice I did NOT write &quot;has got to be&quot;) one of the most difficult exercises I know. I&#39;ve tried it a couple times before.

So, try it sometime.
