Ouch. I&#39;m working on a client&#39;s site today and I find out that <a href="http://www.hostlane.com">his hosting provider</a> does not provide <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>. This is a sad day indeed. I&#39;m currently pleading with tech support. Wish me luck.

Apache zen: If an Apache server does not have mod_rewrite, is it still Apache?
