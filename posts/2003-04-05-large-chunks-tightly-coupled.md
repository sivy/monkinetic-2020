Title: Large Chunks Tightly Coupled
layout: post

<a href="http://www.kottke.org">Jason Kottke</a> <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/04/030404larry_elliso.html">compares </a>the unix philosophy and the Microsoft one:<blockquote>If Unix development philosophy is small pieces loosely joined, Microsoft&#39;s philosophy is big chunks tightly coupled.</blockquote>
Jason uses three words to describe how Microsoft keeps its developers: Friction, Inertia, and Marketing. FIM. I&#39;m not saying that Microsft does not make some amazing products (not including Windows, at least to-date) but that (and this is from experience) it&#39;s an uphill battle to mix unix- and Windows-based applications in an environment, because the design philosophies are so different.

Microsoft [server] apps are designed to work with each other. Period.
