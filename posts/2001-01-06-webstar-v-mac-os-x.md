Title: WebStar V + Mac OS X
layout: post

4D&#39;s WebStar, affectionately known in Mac server circlas as Web*, is coming to &quot;Mac OS X&quot;. Right on - WebStar is a bulwark of the Mac community, has been serving pages from Macs for many years, and has a rich history and rich plugin API. This will be a great addition to the Mac OS X software catalog. Way to go 4D.
