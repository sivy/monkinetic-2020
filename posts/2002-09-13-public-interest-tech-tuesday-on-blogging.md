Title: Public Interest Tech Tuesday on Blogging
layout: post

I forgot to post this on Tuesday when I heard it, but NPR&#39;s <a href="http://www.wamu.org/pi/">Public Interest</a> &quot;Tech Tuesday&quot; had a piece on blogging. (<a href="http://www.wamu.org/ram/2002/p2020910.ram">Real Audio</a>) <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/">Rebecca Blood</a> was the main guest, along with <a href="http://www.lightningfield.com">David Gallagher</a> and Eric Olsen from <a href="http://www.blogcritics.org">BlogCritics.org</a>. All in all it was not a lot of new material, but it was interesting to hear the guests, and amusing to hear Kojo saying &quot;blahg&quot;. -)
