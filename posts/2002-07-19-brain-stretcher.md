Wow. I&#39;m in the process of dredging up some long unused knowledge from my brain, and trying to weld some new knowledge onto it. What a pain -).

The old stuff involves servlets, and the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">velocity engine</a>, and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">ant</a>. I&#39;m also going to try to learn some about unit testing with <a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">junit</a>. Meanwhile, I&#39;m having to learn <a href="http://www.caucho.com/resin/">Resin</a> (couldn&#39;t get tomcat running <acronym title="On My Machine">OMM</acronym>).

So... my head is going in circles. But it&#39;s good - just as my body has needed <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2002/07/15#item1350">a reminder</a> of what it&#39;s capable of, my mind needs it too.
