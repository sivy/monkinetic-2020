Cool! Two of the cool toys I got for Christmas are a <a href="http://www.roadtools.com/product.html">Podium Pad</a> (essential for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook</a> owner) and a Kensington <a href="http://www.kensington.com/html/1211.html">PocketMouse Optical Pro</a>. This mouse is totally cool, with a retractable USB cable that hides in the mouse for easy mobility - and after my ancient MacAlly ball mouse, this mouse is amazing!
