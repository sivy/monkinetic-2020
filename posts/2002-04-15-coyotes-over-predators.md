Title: Coyotes over Predators
layout: post

This afternoon the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/sports/coyotes/0414yotesgamer14-ON.html">Coyotes beat the Nashville Predators</a> to end at 6th place. I never cared about hockey (inspite of
Jim&#39;s obsession with it ;-)) until recently - having an NHL team in town is kinda cool. Still, where DO they get names for these teams? I mean, the &quot;Predators&quot;? Oy.
