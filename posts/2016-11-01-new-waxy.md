title: Redesigning Waxy, 2016
---

Andy Baio, one of my blog heroes, [redesigned his blog, Waxy.org](http://waxy.org/2016/11/redesigning-waxy-2016-edition/) this week. In addition to being a lovely design, it's now responsive and a bit more modern.

What really stands out to me is Andy's comments on the state of blogging these days, why he blogs still, and why he is still investing in a platform that is *all his*. He expresses very eloquently why his blog - and this one - is still going, despite periods of neglect: it's a labor of the heart that connects people in long-form.
