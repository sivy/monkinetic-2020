Title: Hello Monkinetic.com
layout: post

Some of you may have noticed links around here starting to point to a new domain: [www.monkinetic.com](http://www.monkinetic.com). Well, today I finally pushed the Big Red Button that directs all traffic from redmonk.net over to monkinetic.com. In some ways this is a bittersweet moment for me - I still feel a close personal connection to the redmonk moniker (though this site fell from first place in [the google war](http://www.google.com/search?q=redmonk) long ago). I first started using 'monkinetic' as the blog title back when I was trying to make redmonk.net into a business site (ca. 2003 I think) and the name stuck. I've grown to love it, and I'm glad to finally be giving it it's own domain!

Along with the domain move, I'm changing platforms. A bit over a year or so ago, I moved this blog from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) (self-hosted on Dreamhost) to [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org) (also self-hosted). I really like Movable Type (I should, I [make a living](http://sixapart.com/services) building awesome stuff with it!) but I've grown weary of managing the hosting. So I've moved the site to TypePad, and today I flipped the switch to direct all traffic from redmonk.net to monkinetic.com.

There are still some style fixes that need to be applied - I ported the looks and feel from MT to TypePad's advanced templates (I haven't lost my need for control *completely*) and there are loose ends scattered about. But now that this is "Home", I hope to finish the spit and polish soon.

The move to TP also means that commenters can signup/login with their TypePad, OpenID, Facebook, or Twitter accounts, which is a nice touch.

Thanks for reading!
