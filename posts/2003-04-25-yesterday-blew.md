Title: Yesterday Blew
layout: post

Ok, I haven&#39;t had a really BAD (all capital letters) day for a long time until yesterday, and yesterday sucked.

First thing: dentist appointment for cleaning and checkup. No cavities (yay) but the root canal I had 2 years ago is still/re- infected, and I need oral surgery to hopefully fix it and save the tooth. Nothing like the idea of having your face cut into to put a pall on your day.

Second thing; As Jodi <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/04/24#item169">mentioned</a> on her , we took our tabby cat Toby in to the vet yesterday to find out why he&#39;s been losing weight recently. After $300 of tests (he&#39;s worth it) the vet told us that Toby has advanced kidney disease and his kidneys are failing. We&#39;re putting him on a special diet, but he&#39;s not likely to be around a whole lot longer. This is really hard for us - Toby is an awesome cat with a ton of personality. The idea of him suffering, or not being around, is really hard -  especially for Jodi, who&#39;s had him since he was an sweet, excitable little orange fluff.

Finally, Jodi got the word yesterday that, despite being one of the most qualified applicants for a position she applied for, she did not get it. The HR person was really sorry - I think she wanted Jodi to get the job - but it didn&#39;t happen. I think Jodi&#39;s mostly ok about it, but after everything else yesterday, it&#39;s still hard.

So, as you can see, yesterday sucked. Here&#39;s hoping today is better...
