Title: Meg on Insurance
layout: post

While I&#39;m linking to <a href="http://www.megnut.com/">Meg</a>, I might as well point to her roundup of <a href="http://www.megnut.com/life/002547.asp">ways to get yourself insured</a> when you don&#39;t have an employer to do it through.


This is something Jodi and I have been looking at too, since I&#39;m <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">starting my own business</a> right now.
