&quot;Nate&quot;, Jodi, Nate&#39;s cousin, and I are watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0062622">2001: A Space Oddysey</a>. I&#39;ve never seen it, neither has Jodi. It&#39;s funny to see a 1960&#39;s view of life in the twenty-first century, and the movie&#39;s slow as mollasses, but it&#39;s interesting, that&#39;s for certain.
