(from <a href="http://www.whiterabbits.com/MacNetJournal/archives.html#note_328">MacNetJournal</a>) The open-source chat client <a href="http://fire.sourceforge.net/">Fire</a> has been updated to support more AIM features (fire transfers, .mac support, direct chat connections, etc). If iChat is too cutesy for you, check it out.
