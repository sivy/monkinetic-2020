Sid is coming along nicely - although progress is slower than I like. I really want to get to work a new app, but I can&#39;t let myself until Sid hits 1.0. Argh. -)

Recent additions - a labels menu that loads from the site; the ability to manage a list of weblogs for a conversation, and then select one to post to; the settings have been moved to a drop-down sheet.
