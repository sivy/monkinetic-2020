Title: Ready To Code
layout: post

I&#39;m ready to start coding again.

This week a freelance project gone bad resolves itself, and with the air clearing, I&#39;m ready to once again have something to dig into, with mind and keyboard.

_Let the coding begin!_

My co-workers have been mocking me because my song of the week is definitely Michael Jackson&#39;s [Smooth Criminal][1]. I can&#39;t help it, the man could write a HOOK.  Now I&#39;m reading about [creating interactive command-line apps][2] in Java. For me, this is a necessary step in testing my java objects. Even though they&#39;re going to be used in web applications, I find it useful.
