Title: Arizona Adoptive Families camping trip
layout: post

This weekend, Jodi and Adelina and I went camping with a group of families from [Arizona Adoptive Families](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Arizona_Adoptive_Families/), the physical manifestation of a Yahoo group started 4 years ago as a social/support network for, as you can guess, adoptive families in Arizona.

I&#39;ll have pictures later - it was a full weekend and too much to tell right now. But what fun!
