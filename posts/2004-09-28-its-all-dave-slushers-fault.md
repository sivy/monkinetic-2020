title: It's all Dave Slusher's fault
---

Ok, so this is the part where Jodi starts rolling her eyes in dramatic fashion, but I've succumbed to the temptation of responding in audio to Dave Slusher's latest <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/">Evil Genius Chronicles</a> audio post. So of course I couldn't just record it, I had to give it a name:

<a href="http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/jkt/JKT20040927.mp3">Just Keep Talking  - Sept 27, 2004</a>

I may try and figure out how to get that into an &lt;enclosure&gt; thingy, but for now I&#39;ll just throw it out there and see if it sticks.

P.S. Another link mentioned in the post: <a href="http://log.hugoschotman.com/hugo/2004/09/audio_blog_soft_4.html">Hugo Schotmann&#39;s instructions for recording an audio post on OS X</a>.
