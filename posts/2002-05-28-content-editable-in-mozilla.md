Title: Content Editable in Mozilla
layout: post

The Xopus project (I have no idea how to pronounce it) has <a href="http://xopus.org/index.jsp?menu=mozce">released some code</a> that lets you do WYSISYG editing in <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. It&#39;s still pre-release quality, but the samples on their page are impressive.
