Title: Well it's officially by birthday...
layout: post

...and today I&#39;m 32. Funny, I don&#39;t feel 32. But I look at my face in the mirror and there are crow&#39;s feet forming around my eyes, the Arizona sun has roughed my face some, and of course I&#39;m about 25% grey now.

On a pleasant note, I got some birthday money today, so Jodi and I went to <a href="http://rei.com/">REI</a> and I returned laden with a new bike jersey, <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=6721565&amp;parent_category_rn=4927690">cycling shorts</a>, and a <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?productId=47614332&amp;storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;langId=-1">cyclometer</a>. Yay!
