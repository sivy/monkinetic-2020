Title: Nerds and their words
Date: 2012-10-15 18:01

I've worked on blogs, CMSes, or websites for 15 years. I'd completely sworn off them when I left Six Apart. But it looks like I'm growing a new product in that space. We'll see if it survives the replant from fertile mind to product soil. :-)

Stay tuned.
