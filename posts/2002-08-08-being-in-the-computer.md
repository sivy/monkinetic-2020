Title: Being in the computer
layout: post

Jodi <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/129">reviews</a> a couple movies we&#39;ve seen recently, Tron and Dr. Dolittle. We picked up a couple classics at the library - a deal <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com/">Blockbuster</a> can&#39;t touch. -)

It was intersting seeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OCMR/qid=1028785283/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-6059436-9464938">Tron</a> again after all these years - I remember it being a seminal point in my childhood (I was 11 when it came out), as do many other geeks I&#39;m sure. The movie effects were not the incredible effects I remember, yet I can see how they were breakthroughs at the time. Jodi put it best: &quot;You geeks just liked it because it shows your dream - being <i>inside</i> the computer!&quot;
