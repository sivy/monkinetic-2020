Title: Java RSS, Part 3
layout: post

Ok, I&#39;ve got my new Java RSS parser working on the two redmonk feeds (<a href="http://www.redmonk.net/redmonk.rss">rss 0.91</a>, <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/redmonk.rdf">rss 1.0</a>). I need to test it on some more feeds, but for now I&#39;m going to work on integrating it into an app I&#39;m working on. If all goes well, I&#39;ll be releasing the app (it&#39;s a web app) at some point in the future.
