Title: Yet Another Update Post
layout: post

So, perhaps I should rename this site to &quot;That-Which-Shall-Not-Be-Updated&quot;. ;-)

I&#39;ve now been at [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) now for about 3 months, and I&#39;ve worked converting website templates, done some design work, and developed the (X)HTML and CSS foundation for two of our applications. All in all, focused and engaging work.

On the home front, Adelina has been playing soccer (and [really enjoying it](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/gallery/view/firstsoccergame/IMG_0712.JPG.html)!), and she made it through her Fall break. Fall break was interesting - her first whole week off, and it meant staying with a kind neighbor for several hours a day. It took her a couple days to adjust to being around new people so much, and she was pretty emotional all week.

To finish the week up in style, we did some research and headed out to Apache Lake, north and east of Phoenix, for an overnight camping trip - our first in several years, and Adelina&#39;s first ever! (For a picture of the lake, see [here](http://www.usps.org/localusps/phoenix/Images/2006ApacheLake090.jpg) - our campsite was just to the left and behind you from this angle - no, that&#39;s not me in the picture - funny, [Mark](http://borkware.com)) It wasn&#39;t quite as beautiful as in the picture - the lake level had been dropped by about 20&#39; for dam inspections.

So, what&#39;s new with you?

Update: our pictures from the trip are up, starting with [this one](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/gallery/view/fallbreak06/IMG_0818.JPG.html).
