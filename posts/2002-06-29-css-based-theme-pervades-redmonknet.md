Title: CSS-based theme pervades Redmonk.Net
layout: post

I finally got around to switching the rest of this site over to the CSS-based them I use on the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">homepage</a> (blog). I believe it loads a bit faster now, too. (Check one more thing off my redmonk TODO list...)
