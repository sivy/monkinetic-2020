Title: What happened to Dave's permalinks?
layout: post

For some reason Dave, from <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/01#hitABump">this link</a> on down on todays&#39; Scripting News, there are no permalinks on the entries. I&#39;m not logged on as &quot;me&quot; right now so I can&#39;t email you. What happened?
