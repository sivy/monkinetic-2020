Title: Locke on Gov't
layout: post

This weekend I was encouraged to check out Locke&#39;s writings on government, specifically the <a href="http://www.orst.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/2nd-contents.html">Second Treatise Of Civil Government</a>. This post is so I (and others) can find it again later.
