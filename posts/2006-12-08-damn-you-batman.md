Title: Damn You, Batman
layout: post

There's a hysterical [Q&A with Sylvester Stallone](http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30904) on on [AICN](http://www.aintitcool.com) . Here's a great one:

>Q: How do you think the template for cinematic heroes has evolved from that of the action stars of the eighties? Where do you see it evolving in the future?

>A: I believe the culprit in the transformation of action films can be traced to BATMAN starring Michael Keaton. By that I mean, when an individual can step into a latex suit bulging with muscles and Velcro himself into an action star body we knew the times they were a-changing. It's tough enough to go to the gym and stay in good shape, but when you have the option to step into a Herculean Halloween costume; working out doesn't look like much fun. Damn you, Batman.
