Title: Spring Break
layout: post

Adelina had spring break this last week, and she and Jodi had a lot of fun going to different local attractions. The most notable were The [Wildlife World Zoo](http://www.wildlifeworld.com/), and the [Arizona Science Center](http://www.azscience.org/).

But it&#39;s also been a tough week, as Adelina&#39;s routine has been disrupted, so she and Jodi were occasionally at loggerheads. By Wednesday Adelina was looking forward to going back to school, and by Friday I came home early from work to take over with Adelina so that Jodi could get a break.

It was a great week, but we&#39;re all looking forward to getting back into the normal swing of things!
