One of my co-workers is somewhat of a lyricist/songwriter/singer. I&#39;ve been listening to his demos for a few days now, and I&#39;m pretty impressed. The <a href="http://www.coloured.net/music/index.html&quot;">demos</a> are rough, to be sure (and &quot;Johnny&#39;s voice is an acquired taste&quot;), but his stuff gets in your head and doesn&#39;t leave. Esp. check out <a href="http://www.coloured.net/music/clips/10years3days.mp3">3 Days</a>, <a href="http://www.coloured.net/music/clips/bookworm.mp3">Bookworm</a>, and <a href="http://www.coloured.net/music/clips/southmountain.mp3">South Mountain</a>.
