Title: Heading Home
layout: post

Well, tomorrow ends our 2+ week sojourn in Jacksonville, Florida. We&#39;ve been helping to care for Jodi&#39;s grandmother Becky, who is suffering from cancer. Jodi has done the lion&#39;s share of the work - I&#39;ve tried to support her the best I could.

I want to write more about what it&#39;s been like here, caring for someone dealing with a life-threatening disease and all that comes with it, but I think that it&#39;s not yet my story to tell. Perhaps at some point it will be.

We love you Becky.
