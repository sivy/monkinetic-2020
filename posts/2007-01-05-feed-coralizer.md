If you find yourself behind a firewall or filter that blocks popular podcast file servers like libsyn, try out the [Feed Coralizer](http://deliciouslymeta.com/projects/coralizer/coralizer.php). The Feed Coralizer rewrites the feed, routing (mp3/m4a/m4v/wav/aiff/wma/wmv/mov/mp4/mpeg/avi/pdf) files through the [Coral network](http://coralcdn.org).

I have discovered that certain networks do not allow Coral proxying: revision3.com (Diggnation) and dl.tv are two that I know of right now.

Comments and suggestions can be left on this post.
