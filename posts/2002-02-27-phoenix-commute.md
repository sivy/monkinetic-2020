Title: Phoenix Commute
layout: post

I happened to have a digital camera this morning on my way into work, so I snapped this pic of downtown Phoenix. These buildings are about a block from our office.

This is not all of downtown, just the part I see most often on my commute. The larger portion of &quot;downtown&quot; is some blocks south.
