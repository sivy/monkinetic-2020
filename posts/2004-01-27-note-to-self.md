Title: Note To Self
layout: post

Don&#39;t cut off a cop in an unmarked SUV who&#39;s driving his daughter to school in the morning. Bad idea.

I thought the street I was turning onto was two-lane at that point, and thought I was turning into the near lane - it was only after he slowed dramatically that I realized he had no where to turn into.... D&#39;oh!!!

Anyway, when he asked if I knew why he&#39;d pulled me over, I honestly told him that I&#39;d cut him off, and apologized sincerely. He took my license and went back to radio it in - that&#39;s when I noticed the young girl in the passenger seat in my rear-view mirror. Crap, I thought. I cut off a cop with his daughter in the car. I&#39;m dead.

Fortunately he let me off with a warning. *Whew*. Thanks God.
