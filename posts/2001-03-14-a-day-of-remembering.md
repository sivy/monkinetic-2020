Title: A Day of Remembering
layout: post

I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s today, but after hearing on the news lately about the recent school shooting in NY, my mind goes back to a day in December, 1988, at a small christian school in Virginia Beach, VA - Atlantic Shores Christian. On that day in December a young man killed one teacher execution-style, shot another teacher, tried to shoot a third, and broke into a mobile trailer classroom where 20-25 students were huddled at one end after seeing him coming and locking the door.

I never went to the trial, never heard any of the testimony. Today in Google&#39;s cache I found <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.gunlawsuits.com/litigating/articles/civillib.asp+atlantic+shores+shooting&amp;hl=en">this</a> [link dead = 01-22-03]:

&quot;According to the trial testimony, Elliott entered the store with his cousin and indicated an interest in several handguns. Elliott then picked out the MAC-11 and had a lengthy discussion with the sales clerk about its features. Within a few feet of the clerk, Elliott handed $281 to his cousin, walked over to the display case, pointed to the MAC-11 and told the clerk, &quot;that&#39;s the one I want.&quot; His cousin then paid for the gun and filled out the federal form as the buyer of the gun. Nicholas Elliott left the store with the pistol in hand. &quot;

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/crime/larsgun.htm">Here&#39;s another account</a>: &quot;On December 16, 1988, Nicholas Elliot, barely sixteen, walked into the Atlantic Shores Christian School, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with a semi-automatic handgun hidden in his backpack. By midmorning a forty-one year-old teacher had been shot dead, and another teacher, struck by two nine-millimeter bullets, was extraordinarily lucky to be alive. Two other teachers narrowly escaped Nicholas Elliot&#39;s bullets. One found herself running a zigzag pattern through the school yard as Nicholas fired round after round at her back. The other, a man who tackled Nicholas and in the process saved the lives of a roomful of crying and praying teenagers, felt a bullet breeze past his head.&quot;

The shooting plays a part in <a href="http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/cs445/Fall00/homework/hw5data/docs/282docs.html">someone&#39;s homework</a>... [link dead - 01-22-03]

Everytime someone mentions Columbine, or New York, or any of the other school shootings, I think back to that day in December, 1988, huddled on the floor of a mobile trailer.
