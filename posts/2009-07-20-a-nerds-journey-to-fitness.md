Title: A nerd's journey to fitness
layout: post

Quick note: I've started riding again (if 4 or 5 rides can be called a habit). Follow my progress (if that's your thing) on my [ride journal](http://redmonk.net/riding/trailrunner/weblog.html). The data is captured via GPS with [iTrail](http://sites.google.com/site/iphoneitrail/Home) on my iPhone, then exported into [TrailRunner](http://trailrunnerx.com/), from which I can publish the journal as a weblog (there's a [feed](http://redmonk.net/riding/trailrunner/weblog.xml)!).

One note, if you're going to use iTrail - in Settings, change your phone's auto-lock to "never", or it will shut down iTrail and you'll get only a few minutes of data.
