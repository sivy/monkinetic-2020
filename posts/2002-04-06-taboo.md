Title: Taboo!!!
layout: post

<a href="http://www.mrbarett.com">Damien</a> and <a href="http://www.120degrees.com/">Brad</a> finally showed up. After a great dinner of teryaki chicken and (slightly tough to be honest) steaks, we&#39;re sitting down for a bit o&#39; Taboo...

<i>Update</i>: Oh my god. What a gas. Kenda (local friend who was over and stuck around for the party) rocked us all in Taboo, and we had such fun. What a bunch of freaks.

I have one word for you, Brad: <i>screw</i>.

Damien is working on his email... Mark just posted a picture of our BBQ (<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/iblog/0204.html#05a">call the fire department</a>!)
