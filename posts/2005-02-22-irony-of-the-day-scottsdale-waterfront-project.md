&gt;The 1.1 million-square-foot Waterfront project includes two- and three-story retail and office buildings along [...] along with one eight-story and two thirteen-story residential buildings north of the Arizona Canal.

Ok... &quot;waterfront property&quot; in the Valley of the Sun. Seems a bit of a stretch to this east coast guy.
