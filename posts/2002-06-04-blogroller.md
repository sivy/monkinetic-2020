OK, I finally got around to creating and populating a blogroll over at <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">blogrolling.com</a>. I know it&#39;s a fad perhaps, but I can&#39;t help it. (For those who don&#39;t know, a blogroll is a list of other blogs you read, and want to link to as a sign of respect.) The cool thing is that I now include my blogroll on this page via the <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com/br/rss.php?r=7318f359722ae64ccc8a8b984f830ced">RSS version</a> of it. Now *that&#39;s* nifty.
