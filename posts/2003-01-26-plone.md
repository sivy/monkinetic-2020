My good friend Jim recently <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/2003/01/23#item6133">released</a> a Mac OS X installer for <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a>, a <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>-based CMS.


I downloaded the installer and (after reporting a bug and creating a necessary directory) successfully installed Plone. After poking around a bit, I can see that it&#39;s quite deep, and is going to take some time to grok.


It&#39;s my hope that Plone may become something I would recommend as a customizeable CMS solution for clients who are running (or want to run) linux or Mac OS X servers. We&#39;ll see.
