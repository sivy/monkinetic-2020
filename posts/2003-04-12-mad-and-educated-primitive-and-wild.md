Title: Mad and Educated, Primitive and Wild
layout: post

Hm. The first song in my &quot;R.E.M. Revealed&quot; playlist (random songs from my extensive R.E.M. collection) this morning: <a href="http://www.remrock.com/remrock/lyrics/albums/document.html?song=welcome">&quot;Welcome to the Occupation&quot;</a>.
<blockquote>
Hang your collar up inside <br />
Hang your dollar on me <br />
Listen to the water still <br />
Listen to the causeway <br />
You are mad and educated <br />
Primitive and wild <br />
Welcome to the occupation <br />

Here we stand and here we fight <br />
All your fallen heroes <br />
held and dyed and skinned alive <br />
Listen to the Congress fire <br />
Offering the educated <br />
primitive and loyal <br />
Welcome to the occupation <br />

Hang your collar up inside <br />
Hang your freedom higher <br />
Listen to the buyer still <br />
Listen to the Congress <br />
Where we propagate confusion <br />
Primitive and wild <br />
Fire on the hemisphere below

Sugar cane and coffee cup <br />
Copper, steel and cattle <br />
An annotated history <br />
the forest for the fire <br />
Where we open up the floodgates <br />
Freedom reigns supreme <br />
Fire on the hemisphere below <br />
Listen to me<br />
Listen to me<br />
Listen to me<br />
Listen to me

It seemed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2722973.stm">relevant</a>.
