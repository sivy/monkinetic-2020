Title: Schmuck in sportscar rear-ended by hospital truck...
layout: post

Yes, that&#39;s the kind of day I had yesterday. On my way to pick up my car from the shop, my dad and I were rear-ended in his Mazda RX7 by a mobile radiation unit truck from the very hospital I ended up at afterward. Ironic, isn&#39;t it?

Luckily, it&#39;s only whiplash, and I have narcotics to make it Allllllllll better. At least temporarily. ;-) So I&#39;m at home today, resting and treating my neck and back with ice and heat.
