Title: The Point Of Blogging
layout: post

[Dave Winer](http://scripting.com) [has an idea](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/06/21/getsToThePoint.html) for a conference session:

>**Gets to the point**

&gt;An idea for a conference session...

&gt;A-list blogger sits at table in front of room.

&gt;Participants line up. Each, in turn, dictates a 140-character blog post, which the blogger dutifully enters, verbatim. Two or three links. Next.

&gt;Sort of an open blog.

&gt;Only works for bloggers with a certain amount of flow, or A-list goodness to bestow.

I know Dave likes to think &quot;out-loud&quot; on SN, but my reaction to this was that it seems to go against everything blogging means, and everything Dave has stood for in the past. I mean, to me the *point* of blogging was that everyone could do it? That it was dis-intermediation in action? What Dave is describing here seems like a re-hash of the current journalism/media model: You (the citizen) can only be heard if you tell your story to the appointed representative of the media (the A-lister) who will tell others that they should listen.

If I may diverge: I wonder sometimes what the existence of the A-list means in the blogging world, and I do think that one way A-listers can &quot;give back&quot; is to give flow to others. In general, Dave still does a good job of this. But I don&#39;t know that the A-listers have a &quot;responsibility&quot; to link to you or me - I don&#39;t want to be told who or what to link to, I don&#39;t imagine they do either. I&#39;m generally content to live and blog in a different ecosystem than the A-list.

But Dave&#39;s thought exercise worries me in a way I can&#39;t quite put my finger on. Bloggers recently are pushing into journalistic territory, pushing for recognition as journalists, perhaps wanting some of the cachet that comes with being recognized as a member of the [Fourth Estate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_estate). I&#39;m not sure. But as bloggers start seeing themselves as journalists, will they start seeing themselves as the arbiters as well - with the *right* to determine what is news-worthy?

I like to think that in the grand scheme of things, the proliferation of the blogging and bloggers outside of the existing media model will prevent this sort of co-option of our medium.
