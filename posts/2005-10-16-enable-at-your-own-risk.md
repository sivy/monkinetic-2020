Title: Enable At Your Own Risk
layout: post

Heh. I found this on Dreamhost&#39;s Goodies page:

&gt;Frontpage extensions are the bane of many a webhost&#39;s existence! We highly recommend you NOT turn them on! Frontpage is perfectly usable without them, and if you need to add form-to-email to your website, we already provide it! Anything Frontpage extensions allow you to do, there&#39;s already an easier, better, more stable way to do it! Still, if you absolutely ABSOLUTELY absolutely must have FP extensions enabled on a domain, go here to do it. Realize then PHP won&#39;t work, CGI won&#39;t work, ftp won&#39;t work, and you&#39;re *basically taking your website&#39;s life INTO YOUR OWN HANDS!!*
