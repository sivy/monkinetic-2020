Title: "Recent Work: The Frankenapp"
layout: post

In case you haven&#39;t noticed the Quick Links (or haven&#39;t cared, as is likely with a large percentage of my reading demographic) I&#39;ve been working on a rewrite of one of our apps at work, and part of that rewrite is some nifty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29"><acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</acronym></a>-based stuff. I think it&#39;s going to make the app quite a bit nicer to use. I&#39;ve started calling this the &quot;Frankenapp&quot;: it&#39;s a FileMaker Pro webapp where FMP&#39;s template output is post-processed by PHP, and includes several hundred lines of JavaScript, plus the code that handles the XML back-and-forth (also crossing the FMP-PHP bridge) to make it act *nice*.
