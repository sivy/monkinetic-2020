Title: Building a WebObjects Resource
layout: post

The <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/webobjects-talk/">WebObjects-talk list</a> is heating up as developers brainstorm on creating a site (or sites) where developer-to-developer (D2D?) information about WebObjects can be posted/organized. I love this sortof Grassroots self-help stuff.

I started a site that I&#39;ll point to now, http://www.talesofwo.com. Tales Of WO is just such a site, but more a weblog for WO Newbies. I&#39;m thinking of adding a directory to the site, too. We&#39;ll see.
