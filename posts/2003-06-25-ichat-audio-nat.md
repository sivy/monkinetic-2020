Title: iChat Audio & NAT
layout: post

I&#39;ve found that my success using the new iChat AV and audio chat has been sketchy, and I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s related to the fact that one or both of use is behind a NAT. Anyone work out what ports iChat AV uses for audio chat?

<i>Update</i>: This <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=93208">Apple technote</a> explains that iChat AV uses UDP 5060. Meanwhile, I&#39;m still having little luck with audio chats.
