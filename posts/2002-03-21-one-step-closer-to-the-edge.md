Title: One Step Closer To The Edge
layout: post

I&#39;m only one or two steps from being able to realize a dream I&#39;ve had for the last 5 or 6 years. I&#39;ve been developing web applications since 1996, and like all geeks I&#39;ve longed for a server of my own. ;-)

Well, a month or so ago we finally got real, two-way <a href="http://www.cox.net/">Cox cable access</a> at home, which means I finally have always-on internet and a relatively stable ip address. My hosting provider has graciously agreed to set up a dns entry for me that points to my home network. I&#39;ll finally be able to run my own server from home. I cannot say how happy I am to be so close to seeing this happpen.

Now, if I can only get my router and cable modem to agree on an ip address...
