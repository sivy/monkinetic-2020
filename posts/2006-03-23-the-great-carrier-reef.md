Title: The Great Carrier Reef
layout: post

I couldn&#39;t resist - the headline used in the local paper was too good. The aircraft carrier Oriskany, veteran of the Korean and Vietnam conflicts and base of operations for Senator John McCain while he was a Navy pilot, is [being sunk](http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,635190045,00.html) off the coast of Florida to create the largest man-made reef to date. I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s going to be a wild sight.
