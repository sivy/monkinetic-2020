Title: "Whoa: Drag to subscribe to Podcast in iTunes"
layout: post

Not sure if this is new in <a href="http://apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> 6, but on whim I tried dragging a link to <a href="http://43folders.com">Merlin</a>&#39;s new podcast onto the &quot;Podcasts&quot; group in iTunes. *Boom* - it subscribed to the podcast and started to download the most recent show. *Apple rocks*.
