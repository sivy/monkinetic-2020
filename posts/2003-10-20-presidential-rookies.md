Title: Presidential Rookies
layout: post

Sen. Leiberman is calling his Democratic Presidential opponents <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/lieberman/">rookies</a> who aren&#39;t ready to be President.

What he&#39;s not saying is that the President is an executive office, for which a legislative career does not necessarily prepare one. So in a sense, Senator Leiberman is as much a rookie as his opponents may be, <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com">Gov. Dean</a> and <a href="http://www.clark04.com/">Gen. Clark</a>.
