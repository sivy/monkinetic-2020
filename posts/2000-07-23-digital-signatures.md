**Jon Udell on digital signatures**

Jon Udell, author of &quot;Practical Internet Groupware&quot;, and the column [Tangled In The Threads][1] for [BYTE][2] magazine, has a really good exporation of digital signatures in his [latest column][3].

This is interesting to me since my [company][4] is working with a partner whose main product uses very secure digital signature technology, and we&#39;re dealing with the issues involved for users. Check out the article.
