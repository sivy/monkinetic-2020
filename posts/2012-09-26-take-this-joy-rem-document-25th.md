R.E.M. (their label, really) has released a remastered version Document celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1987 album.

If you're a fan[^1], [get it now](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/document-25th-anniversary/id560693361).

Update: I bought the album and not only do the remastered original tracks sounds *great*, the newly released live material is excellent.

[^1]: You're a fan if you can sing along with most of this album. You're a True Fan&trade; if you can sing along and hit the timing every time Michael Stipe yells "FIRE!" on One I Love.
