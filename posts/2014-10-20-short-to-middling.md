Gina Tripani posted her thoughts on what she calls [short-form blogging](http://scribbling.net/2014/10/16/short-form-blogging/).

> "With the obvious caveat that rules are made to be broken (with reason), my new rules for blogging are:"

- If it's a paragraph, it's a post.
- Traffic is irrelevant
- Simplify, simplify
- Ask for trusted collaborator feedback
- Have fun

The kinds of rules I want to get back to.
