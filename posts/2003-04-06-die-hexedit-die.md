Title: Die, Hexedit, Die!!

Every once in a while, you really need a hex editor. <a href="http://hexedit.sourceforge.net/">HexEdit</a> seems to be the only freebie I've found for OS X.

HexEdit has a nasty habit of hijacking file types - first it was Disk Images, now PNG files. I really, really hate that. The only filetypes an app should automatically register itself for are the ones it OWNS.
