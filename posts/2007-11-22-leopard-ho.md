Title: Leopard Ho
layout: post

"Big Cat" references aside, Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" is pretty nice. My favorite feature so far is probably Spaces - though [others have pointed out](http://twitter.com/raster/statuses/432512642) that it's hardly the 1st implementation of "virtual desktops' on Mac OS X, and it's missing some features, it's (understandably) the best integrated of any implementation so far. *And* it makes my 17" monitor at work actually useful. My only gripe is that I want/need different desktop backgrounds for each Space so that I can remember where I am.
