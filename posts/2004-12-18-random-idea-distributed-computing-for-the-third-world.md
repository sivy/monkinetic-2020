Title: "Random Idea: distributed computing for the third world"
layout: post

A random idea I had the other day: create a distributed client system like SETI, where the processing time is being donated to third world or developing countries where processing power is hard to get. I don&#39;t know what the data sets would be, nor how it would all be setup, but it&#39;s an idea.
