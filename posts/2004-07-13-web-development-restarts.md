&gt;Considering HTML&#39;s stagnation and pain, this may be hard to believe fully, but I&#39;m serious. They talk about things like Digital Signatures, tabbed/wizard interfaces, rich text editing, spreadsheets, and drag and drop, not to mention simpler stuff like date inputs, sliders, and repeatable rows.

&gt;All of this means we&#39;re likely to see a web application renaissance, and thus a software application renaissance. The train to the future is starting up again!
