I wonder if that&#39;s true. We&#39;ve seen the Google effect when webloggers start linking to something. Someone spouts some bile - can the weblog community resist linking it? That&#39;s my idea of routing around it. If we link it, it is soon rising in  Google&#39;s ranks, the internet equivalent of a PR victory. So yes, maybe we can route around it, but I&#39;m not certain.
