I'm not a big gamer. In fact, I'm not a gamer at all right now. But for about 8 months I played [EVE Online](http://eveonline.com), the decade-plus-old MMORG of internets spaceships, and I got hooked. I mean, Internet Spaceships?! I wandered around on my own for a while, got into a corp that got AWOXed, then found [Rixx Javix](http://eveoganda.blogspot.com/) and [Stay Frosty](http://stayfrostyeve.com/), which became  my adopted piratey home. YARR!

Even though I ran out of time and resources to play, I still follow along on Twitter and other social media and forums, especially the goings on in Stay Frosty.

This week is [Fanfest](http://fanfest.eveonline.com/en/default), the huge gathering of EVE players and [CCP Games](http://www.ccpgames.com/en/home), the company that makes EVE, all in Reykjavik, Iceland. Some of my ex-corpmates (including Rixx) are there, so it's fun to follow along and see what news comes next!

Stay Frosty!!
