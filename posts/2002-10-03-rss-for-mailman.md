Title: RSS for MailMan?
layout: post

I would love to be able to get some of my mailing lists via RSS. Certain lists I read a lot of, but don&#39;t want to have around cluttering my HD, since I know they&#39;re archived and searchable online. I would love to be able to read them in <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>, following the links to interesting posts.
