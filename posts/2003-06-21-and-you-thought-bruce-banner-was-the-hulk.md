Jim (who&#39;s getting behind in his blogging lately, hehe) pointed me to this <a href="http://www.canada.com/victoria/timescolonist/story.asp?id=73D84657-4D07-4575-91F7-687124FED6B7">great article</a> about Ang Lee and how he &quot;got into&quot; the Hulk character during production... Very good article!
