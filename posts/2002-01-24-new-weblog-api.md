Title: New Weblog API?
layout: post

Techno-Weenie has a proposal for a <a href="http://techno-weenie.com/entry.php/view/1">Common XML-RPC API for Weblogs</a>. While I tend to think of such things as a good idea, in this case I think the API is too specific to Blogger and Manila - the two largest blog hosting services.

Perhaps I&#39;ve been spoiled (of course!) but <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com">Conversant</a> has one of the most extensive XML-RPC APIs I&#39;ve seen, and in general its weblog functionality is far superior to other offerings I&#39;ve tried. While I would like to see Conversant supporting these efforts one day in the interest of compatibilty (as it does now with the <a href="http://xmlrpc.free-conversant.com/docs/bloggerAPI">Blogger API</a>), I probably would not use it.

In fact (as you may notice, evidenced by longer posts) I&#39;ve been using a custom <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> Tool called <a href="http://xmlrpc.free-conversant.com/radioconversant/index">Radio Conversant</a> to post to my weblog, edit messages, edit templates, etc. It&#39;s coooool, and makes extensive use of Conversant&#39;s wonderous API. ;-)
