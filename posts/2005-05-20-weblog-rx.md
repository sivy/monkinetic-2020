Title: Weblog Rx
layout: post

So I&#39;m driving to work this morning and I realize that I&#39;m missing my weblog! In the last month I&#39;ve posted *6 times*, and that&#39;s simply lousy. Posting here used to be a three-times-daily prescription, and I think I need to get my prescription refilled.
