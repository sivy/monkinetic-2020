layout: post

<a href="http://www.truerwords.net">Seth</a> has been writing about many aspects of <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/articles/mozilla/index.html">development for the Mozilla browser</a> for a while now, and he&#39;s finally gotten published! Seth contributed <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/articles/mozilla/firefoxhacks.html">a number of hacks</a> to the new <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/firefoxhks/index.html">Firefox Hacks book</a> from O&#39;Reilly.

Sincere apologies to Seth for letting this post sit in my drafts folder for so long before getting it out there - congrats man!
