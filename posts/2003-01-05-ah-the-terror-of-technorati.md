Title: Ah, the terror of Technorati
layout: post

I should never pay attention to the weblog popularity contests/ link-tracking sites like <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, because I&#39;m not a popular blogger and will likely never be. I&#39;m interested in too many things, and get distracted too easily. I&#39;m rarely effectively witty, and too clever for my own good. I don&#39;t write too badly, but I&#39;ll never win an award for it, and the only time I&#39;m gaspingly passionate is when I&#39;m about to stick my foot in my mouth.

Therefore, seeing that Technorati says only <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&amp;url=www.redmonk.net%2Fmonkinetic">6 other bloggers</a> are linking to me should be absolutely no surprise. (Even checking <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&amp;url=www.redmonk.net/">my former blog self</a> only reveals 18 links). Stupid popular bloggers.
