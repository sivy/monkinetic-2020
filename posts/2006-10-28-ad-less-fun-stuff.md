Title: Ad-less, fun stuff
layout: post

I finally got around to removing the Google ads from monkinetic. I never did make money off them (though Google insists it sent me a $100 check back in &#39;05 sometime) and I was beginning to find them annoying. So... buh bye.

I also spent 10 minutes last night and tweaked the &quot;R.E.M. says&quot; box: it now loads a new quote when you click the &quot;tell me more&quot; link, and I added a picture of the band, for, you know, fun.
