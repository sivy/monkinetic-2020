I rode another 8 miles this morning, in approx 30 minutes. I don&#39;t own a watch, so I have to guess on the time, but the distance is easy to judge. Here in the valley, major intersections are all 1 mile apart, so ust count intersections to find out how far you&#39;ve gone. -)

This morning, my first two miles were into a brisk wind, so I was hunched over, trying to present as low a profile as possible... <i>man that&#39;s a lot of work</i>. My butt and hamstrings are complaining now. <i>Feel the burn!</i>
