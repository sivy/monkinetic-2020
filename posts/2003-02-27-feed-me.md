Title: Feed Me!
layout: post

Inspired to go looking after Dave linked to the perl.org <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/rss/">RSS feeds of their job listings</a>, I just found that <a href="http://www.jobmart.com">jobmart.com</a> has feeds of each of their job databases:<ul>
<li>Mac OS X: http://macosx.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed</li>
<li>Linux: http://linux.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed</li>
<li>Python, Plone, Zope: http://python.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed</li>
<li>Wireless: http://wireless.jobmart.com/Resumes/JobOpennings/RssFeed</li>
</ul>

Very cool! I&#39;ve subscribed to several.
