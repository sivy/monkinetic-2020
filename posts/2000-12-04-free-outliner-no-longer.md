Title: Free Outliner? No Longer...
layout: post

<a href"http://jim.roepcke.com/2000/12/03#item1413"="href&quot;http://jim.roepcke.com/2000/12/03#item1413&quot;">Jim points out</a> that <a href="radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>, once promised to be a free distribution, will actually have a <a href="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/">moderate price once officially released</a>.

&quot;Eventually we will put a moderate price on Radio -- to get our new community started, please give it a try and use it for free, with our appreciation.&quot;

I&#39;ve been looking at developing several Tools for Radio Userland, with the possibility of wide deployment at work. Don&#39;t know how that&#39;s going to play now...
