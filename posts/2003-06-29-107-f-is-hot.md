Hey Robert, be glad you&#39;re not in Phoenix then! It was a pleasant 110&degree; in the shade today! Cars usually get 15 or more degrees hotter.

Of course, we&#39;d still love for you to come visit - hey, it&#39;s my birthday tomorrow - we&#39;re having cake and ice cream at 7:00pm. Stop on by!  I promise it won&#39;t be *too* hot! smile
