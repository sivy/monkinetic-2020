Been checking out <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">Amphetadesk</a> again lately. Amphetadesk is a desktop RSS reader, currently in alpha for version 0.93. Its creator, <a href="http://www.disobey.com">Morbus</a> (aka <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/779">Kevin</a>), has been doing a great job - Amphetadesk has a new architecture that makes for easy hackability, a virtue for any perl-based software, which Amphetadesk is.

I also appreciate that Amp (as it is affectionately known by some) is faceless and completely background - it&#39;s just there, taking up precious few resources while doing it&#39;s work.
