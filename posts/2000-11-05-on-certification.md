Title: On Certification
layout: post

I&#39;ve been encouraged by many in my profession to work on getting Microsoft Certified. Practically the entire network engineering staff at my comany is in a race to get the most MC*s after their name.

I&#39;ve often wondered about the whole certification &quot;thing&quot;. I&#39;m not super-programmer, but I&#39;ve got a very broad set of knowledge - including several scripting and programming languages, mac and unix system scripting, web design and development, basic OO programming, XML, and more. all this I&#39;ve learned on my own motivation over the last 6 years I&#39;ve been in the field.

Point One: I wonder which Certification would show prospective empoyers or clients that I know what I&#39;m doing and would encourage them to hire me? I don&#39;t think there is one.

Point Two: The Certifier (usually a vendor) gets to decide what knowledge is relevant to know about their product. In the case of Microsoft, when the test asks me what product will best meet a client&#39;s needs, you can bet that a Linux-based router running off a floppy won&#39;t be one of the choices!

Point Three: The power to de-certify is too tempting not to abuse. When Windows 2000 came out, Microsoft expired the certification for NT4, meaning that all the MCSE&#39;s that had NT4 certs <i>had</i> to re-certify on Win2K. This meant more revenue for Microsoft in the form of pre-tests, testing, and training. More importantly, by forcing all the MSCE&#39;s to upgrade their skills mid-stream, they would &quot;encourage&quot; enterprises to switch to Windows 2000 sooner than they might have. (Especially right after having spent two years getting all their NT4 machines Y2K compliant.) Note: Microsoft may have changed their minds about that particular decision after an outcry from their maket, but the point stands.
