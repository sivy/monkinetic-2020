Title: Brain Sparks
layout: post

I&#39;ve recently rediscovered <a href="http://www.uie.com/">UIE</a>&#39;s blog on User Interface and User Experience issues, <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/">UIE Brain Sparks</a>. I saw Jared Spool back in &#39;98 at the Thunder Lizard web conference in Atlanta, and was impressed then as well. While I don&#39;t agree 100% with UIE&#39;s conclusions in every case, I like their approach and attention to detail, and the information is the kind of thing I want to file away for future reference.
