Title: Simplicity and the 10-foot UI
layout: post

Every so often, I start thinking again about how I'd design a Home Dashboard - a simplified UI that could run on a spare computer, and provide 10-foot access to information like the day's schedule, weather, a bit of news, today's TV schedule, etc.

I liked [Leah Culver](http://leahculver.com/)'s [comment](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/16/the-death-of-the-url/#comment-112736) on [Chris Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/blog)'s essay on the [death of the url](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/16/the-death-of-the-url/). relating to simplified user interfaces that are re-intermediating the web experience:

>Like you, I dislike limiting the user for the sake of simplicity. Maybe instead of creating dumbed-down UIs, we should be making better devices for controlling computers from a distance?

This idea of better ways to interact with the computer without pulling out a keyboard and mouse is a very good one.
