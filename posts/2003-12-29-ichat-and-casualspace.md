Title: iChat and CasualSpace

John Perry Barlow <a href="http://barlow.typepad.com/barlowfriendz/2003/12/entering_casual.html">posts</a> about iChat AV and the resulting <i>telepresence</i> with Joi Ito.

<a href="http://www.re-mac.com">Re-Mac</a> uses something similar, setting up a video iChat between their two stores during the day. We used it to communicate quickly, and to demo the technology to customers.

During the day, we could hear the phones ringing in the other store, hear the sales people discussing products, and ask questions about stock or machines in for service without using the phone. It made for an interesting experience, and I think we&#39;ll see more of this kind of thing as the technology spreads.
