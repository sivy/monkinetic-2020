Title: Back in Coffee Rush
layout: post

I&#39;m back at Coffee Rush, which currently occupies the &quot;World&#39;s Best Coffee Shop&quot; slot in my mind. I&#39;m working on correspondence and listening to Fleetwood Mac on the shop sound system. (<i>Not</i> on my TiBook, which will never be polluted by that stuff...)
