<a href="http://www.macnn.com/news.php?id=4316">MacNN is reporting</a> that file sharing by Napster&#39;s users is down 60% already. The RIAA is congratulating its smug self today.

<a href="http://www.wirednews.com/news/business/0,1367,42426,00.html">Or maybe not</a>. The RIAA is making some curious arguments, in its bid to <i>limit copyright law</i> so they can stream music <i>without paying the people who own it</i>.

Things that make you go hmmmm.
