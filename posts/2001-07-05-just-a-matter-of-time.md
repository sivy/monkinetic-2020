Title: Just a matter of time
layout: post

Microsoft&#39;s assimilation of NCompass Labs&#39; Resolution CMS is complete. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/evaluation/tour.htm">Exhibit A</a>.<p>

Part of me is glad that the whole CMS genre has finally recieved &quot;acceptance&quot; in the industry, as witnessed by the release of an MS* product in the category. <p>

Most of me however is saddened that I&#39;ll never be able to say &quot;content management&quot; to my superiors again without them subconciously adding &quot;Microsoft&quot; to the front and &quot;Server&quot; to the end...</p></p>
