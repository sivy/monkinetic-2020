Title: McCusker, On The Air
layout: post

Cool, David (Rys) McCusker got himself <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newJan03.htm#04jan03">hooked up</a> with voice recog. software, so he&#39;s dictating his blog now.

I&#39;m looking forward to see how it affects his style - you can already see more paragraphs and free-form prose lately, though I attribute that to his fast-changing life circumstances than to software changes.
