Hm. <a href="http://www.sbc.com">SBC</a> is claiming they have a <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,933,841.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/5,933,841&amp;RS=PN/5,933,841">valid patent</a> on website navigation and is starting to <a href="http://www.museumtour.com/sbclawsuit.html">extort license fees</a> from &quot;infringing&quot; sites.

There is irony to be found in SBC&#39;s actions: In 1999, I worked on a rather large web site contract for a gentleman who had a patent hanging in his office. He had applied for, and received, the patent for work he had done during the heady days of the early multimedia CD-ROM industry. &quot;What...&quot;, you ask, &quot;...did he patent&quot;? Why, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,297,253.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/5,297,253&amp;RS=PN/5,297,253">breadcrumb navigation</a> (in his words).
