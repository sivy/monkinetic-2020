Title: Coding for failure
layout: post

*Whew*. Big thread on Hack The Planet - <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$6921?mode=topic">over here</a>, tangentially inspired by my post <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/fullThread$msgNum=928">here</a> about IDL. David McCusker has a great line:<p>
<i>If the interface doesn&#39;t support the ability to go on, and encourage you to code for failures, then it&#39;s just as fragile as a synchronous interface.</i><p>
Have to read this thread a few times to get it all.</p></p>
