&gt;&gt; Larry wall was quoted as saying:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I remember reading at some point that you are a Christian... Please
&gt;&gt; tell us how in the world a scientific or at least technical mind can
&gt;&gt; believe in God...
&gt;
&gt; One doesn&#39;t need to be a Christian to believe in God. That&#39;s my first
&gt; point.

I&#39;ll grant you that, Don. But at the same time, I don&#39;t think that was
the point. Larry is a Christian (I&#39;m assuming from reading his reply,
and other things he&#39;s written), and the questioner was asking how, as a
scientist, Larry can believe in God. I thought his reply was well said,
and that&#39;s what I was pointing out.
