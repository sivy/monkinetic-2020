Title: Are you sick of Sid yet?
layout: post

I&#39;ve been working on Sid (obviously) for the last couple of days - I made some (finally) very nice improvements to the interface. In the last few versions, the settings for the conversation were done in a drawer. The drawer was almost as large as the document window, which was awkward and just not elegant.

So I decided to change the interface to a set of tabs: Post, Preview, and Settings. Post obviously has the form for posting, Preview gives you a preview of the body of your post, rendering the HTML, and Settings replaces the old drawer with a tab. It&#39;s quite nice actually.

I&#39;ll be releasing version 0.8 sometime today, so check back if you&#39;re interested.
