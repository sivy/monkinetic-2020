[Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com), currently of Omni Software and long-time Mac developer, shares his thoughts on the [Surface Studio](http://inessential.com/2016/10/26/surface_studio_notes). I agree with Brent (and many others) that it seems like Apple has forgotten/disregarded the people who use their computers to *make things* - the same people who stuck with and evangelized the platform during the Dark Times.

Tomorrow, Apple is going to show their new hardware, and I honestly cannot imagine liking anything I see more than I like this Studio PC. That makes me sad. I remember when Apple's hardware was *worthy* of the OS we knew and loved. Doesn't seem like that any more.

I *am* hoping that this lights a fire under Apple's hardware branch - pull them out of their floating white eggs and get them back in the real world, solving real user's problems, and giving us - their users - the breadth and depth of hardware Apple is capable of creating.
