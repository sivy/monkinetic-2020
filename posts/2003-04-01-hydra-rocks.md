If you&#39;re an OS X developer, go get <a href="http://hydra.globalse.org/">Hydra</a> NOW.

Hydra is a network-enabled collaborative editor. Open a source code file, click &quot;Share&quot;. Then your fellow LAN (Rendezvous) or internet-based developers can conenct to our machine and you can work on the file in tandem. It&#39;s perfect for small-team/XP development. Wow. Wow.

<blockquote>Support for C, C++, CSS, HTML, Java, Javascript, LaTeX, Objective-C, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SQL, XML included.</blockquote>

Immediate feature-requests:<ul>
<li>a dock-icon marker showing that there are new changes in one or more of your documents</li>
<li>an &quot;Invite&quot; command</li></ul>

This is seriously cool... stuff.
