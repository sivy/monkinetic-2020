From the <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1071_3-5076175.html">editorial</a> announcing a <a href="http://news.com.com/">News.com</a> redesign and site upgrade:

Users can click a button to save the article to a personal folder. The UI is clean and very usable IMO.

Also, the new site uses XHTML and stylesheets, and load quite quickly.
