Title: A Screenplay in the Family
layout: post

Jodi&#39;s family (parents and younger brother) just got into town. SkyHarbor Airport was (as to be expected) a madhouse, but we successfully managed to find them, reunite them with their luggage, and get them home. Since being out here, we&#39;ve reallly missed family, so it&#39;s really really nice to have them here!

Jodi&#39;s brother, Mark, is a geek with screenwriting aspirations, and we&#39;re sitting here listening to his first screenplay idea. And it&#39;s really really good! I hope he has an opportunity to go for it. His plot seems to move well, with interesting subplots, and I would love to see it as a movie.

Mark&#39;s a great writer - I may have to see if I can get him a blog one of these days... -)
