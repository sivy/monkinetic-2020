I&#39;ve just set out a beta for a new app to a few users. The app is called &quot;TerminalBar&quot;, and it lets you enter a unix command string (any number of commands tacked together with semi-colons), an optional working directory to run them in, and whether or not to open a new Terminal window to run it in (otherwise it gets run in the background).

TerminalBar uses the standard Mac OS X toolbar for its UI, meaning you can rearrange your commands, and maintain a collection of commands while not having them all on the TerminalBar at all times.

The TerminalBar window can be seen <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/images/terminalBarOpen.jpg">here</a>, while the collapsed version can be seen <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/images/terminalBarCollapsed.jpg">here</a>.

After it&#39;s had some burn in and bug fixes, I&#39;ll be releasing it as shareware.
