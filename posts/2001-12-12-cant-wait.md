Title: Can't Wait!
layout: post

Thanks to Google&#39;s new 20 year archive of usenet posts, comes <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.azure.913">this little gem</a>:<p>

<blockquote>&quot;Revenge of the Jedi&quot;... Episode 6 in the Star Wars saga, has just finished filming, according to some friends I have down in Arizona.<br />

The release date for us humans that want to see it is
still the summer of 1983.  I guess it takes that long to score all the music, do all the film-editing, prepare all the promo material, and all that junk.<br />

I wish Lucas &amp; Co. would get the thing going a little faster. I can&#39;t really imagine waiting until 1997 to see all nine parts of the Star Wars series.&quot;<p></p></blockquote>
