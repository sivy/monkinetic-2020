So Scoble says:quoteOf course, you&#39;re welcome to tell me &quot;you suck&quot; via email anytime.endquote
So I did! I hadn&#39;t seen him on AIM in a while, and so I (very tongue-in-cheek) accused him of ceasing his AOL IM activities because he&#39;s going to work for Microsoft.

He <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/04/29.html#a2897">then asks</a> &quot;Why?&quot;, and I, after a change of heart, download and install <a href="http://fire.sourceforge.net">Fire</a>, thereby having a (very nice) non-MS MSN Messenger client.

All is well with the world - I can still chat with Robert (yay!) and he doesn&#39;t have to use AIM. smile
