Title: For Macrobyte
layout: post


Seth and other Macrobyters (that doesn&#39;t sound right...). Attached are three versions of the FriendlyTemplate, and two photo templates. Please respond <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">via email</a>, as I don&#39;t have a private space to do this in. I&#39;ll put up more shortly.

Update: I added a version of the FriendlyTemplateWarm that has the vertical bar on the left.

Update: Added NewEnglandWinterTemplate image. Let Seth know what you think and he&#39;ll pass your comments along, or email me. (Seth - this image is from your site, I was just looking for a winter image. Hope you don&#39;t mind. I won&#39;t use it if you do mind.)



Nothing to see here folks, move along...
