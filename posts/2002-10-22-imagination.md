<a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm">David McCusker</a> gave me a plug yesterday:
<blockquote>And folks need to go visit <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/resume">Steve Ivy&#39;s resume</a> and consider giving him some work. He&#39;s a bright guy with enough imagination that I figure you can give him new stuff to do without worry. (<a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newOct02.htm#21oct02">link</a>)</blockquote>
I usually hate to blow my own horn, but I <i>am</i> a bright guy, I&#39;ve got a lot of experience, and I&#39;ve got the imagination to know how it can be used. If you need web development or Mac OS X programming work done, please <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net?subject=Imagination">contact me</a>.
