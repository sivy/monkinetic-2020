Title: Moving Jo to Mozilla?
layout: post

I&#39;m downloading <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> onto my wife&#39;s Powerbook G3. She&#39;s been using Netscape 4.7, and I&#39;m just hoping that Moz plays nice with her preferences. After browsing on her machine for a while I forgot how badly NS 4.7 renders some sites.

<p>Especially ones moving towards <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">standards compliance</a>.</p>
