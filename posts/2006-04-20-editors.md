Though I&#39;m generally a geek, I work in publishing, so I&#39;ve started paying more attention to some academic and writing-related blog posts that have come cross my radar.

* [The Great Editors](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/04/the_great_edito.html), from Marginal Revolution: <blockquote>I thought about venting my anger here but remembering Ayn Rand&#39;s dictum that justice is about rewarding virtue more than punishing vice I decided to take the high road and reflect on some truly great editors.</blockquote>
* [Rubber Ball Lessons](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/rubber_ball_lessons.php): I&#39;ve been on a personal anti-37signals bent lately (as I&#39;m annoyed by the 37signals-web20-fat-type-bright-colors design brigade) but darn it if [their weblog](http://37signals.com/svn/) doesn&#39;t spit out some interesting stuff.
