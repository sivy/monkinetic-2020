Title: Dave Keynotes OSCOM?
layout: post

Dave is doing <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/04/02#When:2:30:14AM">a keynote</a> at the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/Conferences/Cambridge/">Open Source Content Management</a> conference (OSCOM) in Cambridge.

I find this really interesting, since Dave is mixed bag when it comes to open-source code. He&#39;s released the MacBird source into the public domain, which is really cool. But he also <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/10/24#openSourceMitchAndLarryLessig">likes to say</a> that he ships source with Frontier, but it&#39;s not &quot;open&quot; source - if you were to take Manila or MainResponder and fork it, make some changes, and ship it as your own system for Frontier I guarantee Dave would have a major cow. The source code (usertalk script, not Frontier&#39;s C source) that comes with Frontier is closer to Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/default.mspx">Shared Source</a>: &quot;look but don&#39;t touch&quot;.

&quot;Open&quot; has never just meant &quot;visible&quot;. &quot;Open&quot; has always meant &quot;open to tweaking&quot;... (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php">See #3 here</a>.) It&#39;s related more to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">free software movement</a>, they of the infamous &quot;Free as in speech, not free as in beer&quot; mindset.

So anyway, I don&#39;t really have a problem with Dave keynoting at an open source content management conference, I imagine it will be an interesting keynote at the very least!
