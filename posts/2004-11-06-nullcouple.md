My old buddy Nate (<a href="http://nullgel.com/index.html">nullgel</a>) has gone and <a href="http://nullgel.com/nullgal.html">gotten himself married</a>!!! OMG OMG! As I IMed him...

&gt;Con-frikkin-gratulations, you old coot!

Nate is so very much TEH mAN. He builds <a href="http://nullgel.com/legoart.html">amazing things out of LEGO</a>, including flags and <a href="http://nullgel.com/projects.html">working robots</a>.

Incidently, the link above goes to his new wife&#39;s blog (<a href="http://nullgel.com/nullgal.html">nullgal</a>) because Nate is too much the introvert to blog it himself. I love you man.
