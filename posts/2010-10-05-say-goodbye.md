Title: "SAY: Goodbye"
layout: post


Two years to the week since my first day with Six Apart Services, Six Apart [announced](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2010/09/say-hello.html) that we will be merging with [VideoEgg](http://videoegg.com) to create a new entity, [SAY Media](http://saymedia.com).

Sadly, some of us won't be making the transition, including remote employees like myself.

The last two years have been filled with challenges, moments of total WIN mixed with the occasional growth-inducing FAIL. I got to work with some the smartest people I've ever had the pleasure of working with, on some of the most challenging projects. Whatever happens next, I'll be grateful for the time I got to spend here.

I was proud to work for Six Apart, one of the real game-changers of the blogging revolution, and I'm sad to see Six Apart go away as an entity. But there are a lot of great people here who are going on with SAY Media to impact the web in entirely new ways, and I'm proud of them.

I'm staying on for the foreseeable future, helping complete and transition various projects, but I'm also looking forward to the next opportunity. The most satisfying work I've done over the years has been when I'm making a difference in people's lives - through technology, but also outside of the screen - and that's where I'm setting my sights.
