Jodi and I used to live in the neighborhood of Port Norfolk, where my parents and brother and sister-in-law still live. It was a pain (and dangerous) to have the main road in the neighborhood also be a main thouroughfare to the highway, and the new exit/entrance ramp is supposed to clear out a lot of that traffic.

Last Saturday <a href="http://www.roadstothefuture.com/PPI_Aerial_Feb2004_11.jpg">the new ramp</a> opened, and the nieghborhood had a block party to celebrate! Unfortunately, it looks like they&#39;ve had to close the ramp again while they work out some new traffic smarls that were (evidently) unanticipated. *Sigh*.
