>Each tile is embedded with electrical wiring and connectors. When placed together, the tiles form an electrical network that can span throughout entire rooms.

Designed to work with these networked tiles are &quot;node&quot; tiles, which include: lighting tiles, heated tiles, flat speaker tile.&quot;
