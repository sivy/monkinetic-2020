Title: Weblogger
layout: post

I suspect I&#39;m turning into a not-very-good weblogger. There&#39;s a certain thought process, a certain tendency, that I&#39;ve had before and now seem to lack.

I&#39;m sure that being unemployed has made my brain sloopy and undiciplined... I&#39;ve tried to stay up to speed on certain projects, but one by one my pet projects are suffering neglect. My weblog is one of them.

I did redesign the redmonk site, which was fun, but right now Sid doesn&#39;t work with the new weblog plugin so I can&#39;t use it for this weblog (monkinetic). I&#39;d spend time hacking it to work but the new rpc interface is not done yet.

All in all, I think I&#39;m mildly depressed. It&#39;s an explanation that seems to fit my symptoms, but I&#39;m not entirely sure. I am definitely lacking in motivation.
