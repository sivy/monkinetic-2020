Today was my first day of [PyCon, in Montr&eacute;al, Quebec](http://us.pycon.org/2015/) (my first). I'm headquartered with two other Wells Fargo teammates in the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth (Fairmont de la Reine Elizabeth), a 10-minute walk or so from the [Palais des Congr&eacute;s](http://congresmtl.com/en/), where this year's PyCon is being held. It's an impressive building, though in the end, one tutorial room and conference hallway look pretty much like another.

Timezone changes (west-to-east sucks) had me up later than I wanted last night, and up earlier than I wanted this morning, but I walked over to the Palais in the brisk 40&deg;F weather to get registered. One coffee later I found myself in the room for the first tutorial session I had registered for, only to find that I had not actually registered. The staff person managing the room was kind enough to let me stand in the back after all the sold-out seats had been filled, so I was able to at least listen and follow along with the notes.

This session was [Descriptors and Metaclasses](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/302/), and dug much more deeply into these advanced topics than I had before. My daily work digging through [Horizon](https://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-dashboard/)'s internals made more sense especially after the presenter -- Python Academy's Mike M&uuml;ller, who did an excellent job -- took us on a tour through the way that Python metaclasses work. My homework tonight while I de-jetlag is to work through the incredibly detailed tutorial notes in iPython notebook and make sure I understand them.

More rest tonight, things begin in earnest tomrrow!
