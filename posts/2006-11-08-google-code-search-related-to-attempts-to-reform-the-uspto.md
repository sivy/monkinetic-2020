Title: Google Code Search related to attempts to reform the USPTO?
layout: post

I was reading an old article on [ars technica](http://arstechnica.com/) ([IBM and OSDL to help Patent Office get organized](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060110-5942.html) -Jan 2006) about IBM&#39;s work with the [USPTO](http://uspto.gov/) to help reform the patent system, and ran across this quote:

&gt;The second part of the new system would be a public, searchable (with search possibly provided by Google), and up-to-date database of Open Source code.

Sounds familiar, sort of like [Google Code Search](http://www.google.com/codesearch), announced sometime in the last couple months I think. I wonder if Code Search came out of work done while looking into this prior-art database?
