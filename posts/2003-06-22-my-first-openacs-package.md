Title: My first OpenACS package
layout: post

I&#39;ve been working all week on a new OpenACS package that does form-to-mail, hopefully in a pretty secure manner. It&#39;s a learning project, and I wanted something pretty useful (so I would not lose interest too quickly) but not so hard that I&#39;d burn out.

Well, this has worked out pretty well, and I think that I&#39;m getting a pretty good grasp of oacs&#39; package manager. I&#39;m going to clean up some stuff, and then have some others look over the code. If it&#39;s deemed worthy, I&#39;ll release it at some point.
