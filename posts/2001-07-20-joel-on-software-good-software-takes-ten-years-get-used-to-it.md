Title: Joel on Software - Good Software Takes Ten Years. Get Used To It.
layout: post

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/stories/storyReader$368">Joel</a>: &quot;Make a ten year plan. Make sure you can survive for 10 years, because the software products that bring in a billion dollars a year all took that long. Don&#39;t get too hung up on your version 1 and don&#39;t think, for a minute, that you have any hope of reaching large markets with your first version. Good software, like wine, takes time.&quot; Excellent read if you are in the business of creating software, or want to be.
