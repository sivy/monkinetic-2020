This has been blogged a number of other places, but I just got around to reading it and you should too.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/artist/glance/-/44591/ref=m_art_dp/104-4315644-0661538">Janis Ian</a> is a folk/rock musician who recorded a number of albums in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and has had a resurgence in the 90&#39;s. I think she is right on about how the music industry <i>should be</i> handling the internet music &quot;crisis&quot;.

A tasty quote:
<blockquote>Again, from personal experience: in 37 years as a recording artist, I&#39;ve created 25+ albums for major labels, and I&#39;ve never once received a royalty check that didn&#39;t show I owed them money.</blockquote>
