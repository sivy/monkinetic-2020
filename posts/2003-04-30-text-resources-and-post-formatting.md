Title: Text Resources and Post Formatting
layout: post

I recently found a solution to a problem that had been bugging me for some time.

Conversant has this really cool email gateway - all posts to this site go out to anyone who is subscribed to the site and has the list feature turned on.

So, when I write a post like <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/04/30#item2084">this one</a>, the post goes out over email, and the &lt;blockquote&gt; tags are stripped. How do my subscribers know where the quote is?

To the rescue: Conversant&#39;s <a href="http://support.free-conversant.com/4002#resourceTypes">text resources</a>. A resource is like a Manila/Radio shortcut: it&#39;s a defined piece of text that gets replaced with something else when the content gets rendered. Resources are most often used for links and images, but Conversant has a powerful resource type called a Text Resource.

A text resource can have anything in it - html, text, and Conversant template macros. So I essentially write my own no-arg macro called &#39;quote&#39;:
<pre>
&lt;!--#if condition=&quot;ioInterface==&#39;email&#39;&quot;--&gt;
----- quote --&lt;!--#else--&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;!--#endif--&gt;
</pre>

If the post is being rendered for email, it inserts the &quot;----quote----&quot; text, otherwise it renders the blockquote tag. A partner resource called &#39;endquote&#39; inserts &quot;------&quot; or the closing blockquote tag.

Now, when excerpting text, I start the excerpt with |quote| and close it with |endquote|, and it gets rendered legibly both on the site and in the list email.
