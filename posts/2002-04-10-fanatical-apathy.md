layout: post

[via <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com">Anita&#39;s LOL</a>] Adam Felber, comedian and regular panelist on <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/">Wait Wait Don&#39;t Tell Me</a> on NPR, has a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~adameft/blogger.html">blog</a>! A sample:
<blockquote>Last night&#39;s Academy Awards ceremony, one of the longest in recent memory, showed us a Hollywood that was forced to take a good long look at itself and its priorities in the wake of September 11th...

...and came to the conclusion that they were even more important than they&#39;d previously thought.</blockquote>
