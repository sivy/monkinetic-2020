Title: Someone needs to make a  UIE + Markover Mashup
layout: post

I&#39;ve recently been reading UIE&#39;s blog again - and I like the short but pointed analyses of how various web sites implement the web design patterns that have evolved over the last 10 years.

However, UIE rarely gives a &quot;here&#39;s the way to do it&quot; example... Perhaps they could partner with someone who would do a &quot;<a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2004/05/howto-markover">markover</a>&quot; of one the sample sites to demo how it &quot;should be done&quot;.
