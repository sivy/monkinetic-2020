Ok, I know we&#39;re going a tad overboard here, but I&#39;m having fun, too. Witness:

&lt;link <br />
&#0160;REL=&quot;neighborhood&quot;<br />
&#0160;TYPE=&quot;text/html&quot;<br /> &#0160;TITLE=&quot;Neighborhood&quot;<br />
&#0160;HREF=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/cgi-bin/neighborhood.cgi?url=www.redmonk.net&amp;fl=html&quot;&gt;

There&#39;s an RSS version in my &lt;head&gt; too, view source for more.

(These are cached, so I don&#39;t feel too bad right now about linking to them. Later I&#39;ll likely take them out to spare Mark&#39;s server).
