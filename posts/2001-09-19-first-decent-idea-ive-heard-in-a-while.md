Title: First decent idea I've heard in a while
layout: post

I have no idea if <a href="http://www.sandiegodon.com/1070">this proposal</a> would work, but I like the idea of combining strength and compassion, something Americans have occasionally proven themselves capable of.<p>

&quot; The plan below requires a military component, but allows the US to show that we are compassionate at the same time. It also allows us to build Afghanistan and Pakistan into democracies that we could rely on as allies in the future. It also lets every country in that region understand that the US is not vengeful nor hegemonic.&quot;</p>
