Sorry folks - if you&#39;re reading this site via an RSS aggregator such as <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>, I managed to break my feed tonight, and the descriptions have gone <acronym "absent="&quot;Absent" leave"="Leave&quot;" with-out="With-Out">AWOL</acronym>.
