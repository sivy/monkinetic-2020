Title: Leviticus As Literature
layout: post

Being a Christian, and having done some varied philosophical studies over the years, I&#39;m interested to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199244197/qid=1000833401/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/107-2132250-7925350">Leviticus as LIterature</a>, by anthropologist Mary Douglas. From the description:<p>

&quot;Boldly challenging several traditions of Bible criticism, Mary Douglas claims that Leviticus is not the narrow doctrine of a crabbed professional priesthood but a powerful intellectual statement about a modern religion which emphasizes God&#39;s justice and compassion.&quot;
