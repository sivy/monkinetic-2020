Awesome! The recent episode (&quot;Cross Jurisdictions&quot;) of CBS&#39; hit show <a href="http://cbs.com/primetime/csi/main.shtml">CSI</a> which included the Las Vegas CSI team heading to Miami, was actually the warmup to a CSI spinoff called <a href="http://cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2002/shows/csi_miami/index.shtml">CSI:Miami</a>. Jodi and I are certifed CSI junkies, and this episode was a definite highlight in the series so far.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Caruso,+David">David Caruso</a> was excellent, and the interplay between the Miami CSIs and the Las Vegas CSIs was clever and well written. I can&#39;t wait - <i>2 episodes</i> of CSI each week!
