[AMC](http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-walking-dead)'s and [HBO](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones#/)'s hits are all the rage for the hipsters on the Twitters, but Jodi and I prefer to curl up with a nice [English cozy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_mystery).

> Cozy mysteries, also referred to simply as "cozies", are a subgenre of crime fiction in which sex and violence are downplayed or treated humorously, and the crime and detection take place in a small, socially intimate community.

Some of the series with which we've passed comfy nights:

* [Midsomer Murders](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70187727): 11 seasons and counting - we did love us some Inspector Barnaby. :-)
* [Rosemary and Thyme](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70157272): Gardening sleuths, a perfect example of the genre. 
* All the Morse/Lewis mysteries - [Inspector Morse](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70224749), Inspector Lewis (no longer on Netflix), and the Morse prequel series, [Endeavor](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/endeavour/id532210434) (iTunes).
* [Miss Fisher's Mysteries](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70259338): Phryne Fisher, Australian flapper and nosy, independently wealthy investigator (as many of the ameteur sleuths in these shows are :-) ).
* [Poirot](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70208060), naturallement.
