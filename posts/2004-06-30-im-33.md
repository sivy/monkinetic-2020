Title: I'm 33
layout: post

Well, now that the day is about over, I&#39;m going to have to concede the fact that I am now 33 years old.

However, thanks to my friend and employer Joe, <a href="http://www.airzooka.net/shop/default.aspx">I don&#39;t have to act it</a>. :-)

Jodi and I, and 15 of my fellow employees, ate lunch at <a href="http://www.joesrealbbq.com/">Joe&#39;s Real BBQ</a> in Gilbert, AZ, which has mouth-wateringly good beef, pork, and chicken barbeque, and gives you a free lunch on your birthday (complete with drink and birthday cake). Wooooo me!

Finally, Jodi and I want to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/">The Terminal</a>, the new Tom Hanks movie. It was *really* good. I think the movie is a character drama, often comedic but with a poignancy that did not, for me, descend into sappiness.

All in all, a great birthday. Jodi is my best friend, and she really cares about making birthdays special. Thank you so much, love, for your deep heart and thoughtful ways!
