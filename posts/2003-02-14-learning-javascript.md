Title: Learning JavaScript
layout: post

After basically trying to ignore DHTML for a really long time, I&#39;ve begun venturing into new territory lately.

First up, I have a client who was interested in having his case study images put into a JavaScript-powered slideshow. I looked at the site he had found with an example, then found a script at <a href="http://www.codelifter.com">CodeLifter</a> that basically did what he wanted. I then spent a day tweaking it and figuring out how to mix the script into the CMS the site runs on. I&#39;m happy to say it&#39;s 95% there and the client is happy.

Next, I decided to try something a bit different. The form I use to post to this site is pretty long - I have 21 different categories that I post to and the checkboxes take up quite a bit of space. Sometimes I like to see the page without the form, so I did some research at the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/">Gecko DOM reference</a> (written for Netscape&#39;s Gecko html renderer but useful for any standards compliant browser) and figured out how to use JavaSCript and a DIV&#39;s <code>display</code> property to expand and collapse the DIV the posting form is in. Schweet!

I&#39;m also learning to use the Mozilla javascript debugger, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">Venkman</a>. (Think Ghostbusters.) It&#39;s sketchy at times, but has already helped me find some (admittedly stupid) bugs.
