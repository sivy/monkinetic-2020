Heh. You&#39;ll have to read most of <a href="http://markbyron.blogspot.com/">this page</a> to find the reference (or cheat and go <a href="http://markbyron.blogspot.com/2002_12_01_markbyron_archive.html#85637749">here</a>), but I like Mark Byron&#39;s writing and his daily Biblical and political commentary. Good food for thought.
