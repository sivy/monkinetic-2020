Title: Doc on DRM
layout: post

Doc Searls writes a <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/08/02#losingTheDrmStory">longish essay</a> on the state of &quot;Big Entertainment v. the populace&quot;.

I&#39;ve been following this story for quite some time now, and never been able to put my feelings into words. I&#39;m one of very few geeks in my social circle, so discussing these things there doesn&#39;t go very far - not enough shared cultural infrastructure. Doc&#39;s article sums things up well - I try not to dwell on it much because it just gets my frustration level up there on the scale. Read it, it&#39;s good.

I wonder if anyone has done a &quot;Joe Q. Public&quot; explanation of how Big Entertainment is working to keep us in line...
