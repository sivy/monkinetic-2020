Title: "Scriptogram: Beware the 12-hour Timestamp"
Date: 2012-09-24 22:09

I was having some sorting issues on the blog here, and it took me a couple hours to realize that Scriptogram inserts *12-hour* timestamps into new posts created in the dashboard:

![12-Hour Timestamp is the name of my next band](http://static.monkinetic.com/files//12-hour-timestamp-20120924-200741.png)

I can change the timestamp in the edito before posting, but it's a bummer that it's necessary.
