Robert Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/17.html#a2290">responds</a> to my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/02/17#item1831">last post</a>:

<blockquote>They all miss the point. By putting ink into a real OS and not just a Palm device, Microsoft has brought us something dramatically new. Apple never had that vision with the Newton</blockquote>

I agree that Apple never had that vision. But when I (and I presume others) envision the Newton circa 2003, it&#39;s a device like the TabletPC - say, 8&quot;x11&quot;, running Mac OS X. There&#39;s already <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/inkwell.html">ink</a> for OS X, but no hardware platform. I think that if Apple had followed up on what people were <i>going to want</i> with the Newton, then we&#39;d be there by now.

And to be clear, when I said &quot;no one would be talking about the TabletPC right now&quot; I meant that a tablet pc would not be news, it&#39;d be &quot;PC vendors today followed Apple&#39;s successful 2000 launch of the Mac Slate, with the introduction of the some-such tablet pc and (why do we need another version of) Windows TabletPC Edition&quot;. I actually meant no slam to NEC - I think the TabletPC is a great hardware platform, and I only wish that Apple had not given up on the Newton and had instead allowed it to mature into what we all wanted it to be.
