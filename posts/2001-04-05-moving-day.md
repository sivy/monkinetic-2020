Title: Moving Day
layout: post

Well, I haven&#39;t been updating this site very often lately... been super busy at work, and at home. Today we (work mates) moved from our old offices (big space, mini-kitchen, large offices) into the new, nice, cubicle-rife space that is the new Compass office. *sigh*. Now working in a mini cube-farm, we&#39;re relegated to headphone use (where before we  each had booming sub-woofers ;-)), and smaller work areas.
<p>
I suppose we&#39;ll get used to it, and it&#39;ll mean a lot less driving between locations for meetings and such. But it&#39;s still a shame.</p>
