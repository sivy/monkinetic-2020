Man, oh man. So I got my PC today, a hand-me-down from my dad. I needed something to test out the sites I&#39;ve been developing on, and I&#39;m sad to say I&#39;ve looked them over.

Now, I&#39;m not really a wild designer - I don&#39;t do anything too crazy on the sites I create. But on every one of my recent sites there&#39;s some little thing that is not working right in IE 6/Win.

<a href="http://www.thedesignexperience.org:8089/openacs.org/">Here</a> it&#39;s the main navigation bar. <a href="http://www.xc.org/casateresa">Here</a> it&#39;s the text in a table cell. <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">On this site</a> it&#39;s <i>all the text on the page</i>! Yikes!

Ok, so I&#39;ve got some serious research to do. This is highly unacceptable.
