>&quot;Maybe this is amazing because of the reality distortion field in which we live in the blogosphere.&quot;

I wonder why bloggers find this surprising. Bloggers tend to be well-educated, tech-savvy or even members of the technology industry, and hail from either the west or east coasts, putting them right in the middle of the Kerry camp. Another large group of bloggers hails from outside the U.S., especially in the U.K. or Europe, where the cultural and economic force is a form of democratic socialism. The general political leaning is quite to the left of the heartland of the U.S.

Monday night I listened to several of the Connected Politics sessions from IT Conversations. One in particular caught my attention, the session by The Economist correspondent <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail249.html">Adrian Woolridge</a>.

>&quot;Connected politics is not necesessarily left-wing politics... Taking power away from the political elites, the media elites and the rest of the elites and handing it to the great American public will not necessarily shift politics in the country to the left.&quot;

Listen to the show -- Adrian is excellent, and makes some good points which address this idea that many in the internet demographic hold, that making the political process more dis-intermediated or more &quot;connected&quot; is going to result in a left-ward trend. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s necessarily correct, but it *is* interesting.
