Title: The Freshmaker

I took a few minutes today to freshen up this site's color scheme to match the vibrant one at [echoloquation.com](http://echoloquation.com), my lifestream/tumblog.

IE users, you're out of luck ATM, as the header logo is a "reverse-transparent PNG" with the background color behind it, so from now on I can easily change the color of the logotype just by changing the background color on the image.
