Title: "Hats: Sunday Afternoons"
layout: post

If I get off my butt and start arranging it, I&#39;m hoping to hike part of the Grand Canyon this fall with my brother-in-law. Being a hat-man myself, I immediately decided I would need an appropriate head covering for this adventure. Shelly LeSueur, <a href="http://contentconnections.com">Content Connections</a>&#39; adventuress-in-residence, suggested <a href="http://www.sundayafternoons.com/?id=76389732715&amp;sp=adventure">this magnificent-looking hot-weather hiking hat</a> from a company called <a href="http://www.sundayafternoons.com/"> Sunday Afternoons</a>.

It looks well-made and well ventilated. I&#39;ll have to see where I can find one...
