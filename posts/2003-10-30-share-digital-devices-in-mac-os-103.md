This is too cool. Evidently, using the Image Capture preferences, you can <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031028064213303">share digital devices</a> over your local area network with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS 10.3</a>. Nice!!

Apple mentions it too: <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/">Mac OS X &gt; Features &gt; Image Capture</a>.
