Title: More on blog->iCal
layout: post

I copied and hand-hacked one of my calendars in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/">iCal</a> to see how it might look with blog entries as events. Blog titles get cut down to one word (in week view, my default), and there&#39;s no easy way to see the description unless you use the inpector. iCal is not the ideal blog-reader, by any stretch, but it does open up some interesting possibilities. Not sure what they are yet, but I&#39;m hoping that by spreading the idea someone out there will have some cool ideas on great ways to use this.
