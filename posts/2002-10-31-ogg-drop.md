Title: Ogg Drop
layout: post

I&#39;m trying out this little app called <a href="http://www.nouturn.com/oggdrop/">Ogg Drop</a> - It encodes CD music as <a href="http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html">Ogg Vorbis</a> files (as opposed to MP3, which has a patent/license on it), and supposedly produces smaller and better quality tracks. As soon as it&#39;s done I&#39;m going to restart, since I&#39;ve installed Quicktime 6.0.2, and the <a href="http://www.illadvised.com/~jordy/">Quicktime decoder ring, er, plugin for Ogg</a>, which will let iTunes play Ogg files.
