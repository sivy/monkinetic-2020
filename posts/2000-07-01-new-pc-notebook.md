Title: New (PC) notebook
layout: post

This evening Redmonk.Net comes to you courtesy of the new Win2k notebook that my company got for me. Windows 2000 is very different in some ways. Mostly it&#39;s worse, though there&#39;s a bit more eye candy. I suppose it&#39;s more stable, but I haven&#39;t been using it enough to know yet.

I have to say that a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Apple Powerbook</a> would have been nicer, but the chances of getting that are reaaaallly slim. ;-(
