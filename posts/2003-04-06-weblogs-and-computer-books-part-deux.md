Title: Weblogs and Computer Books, Part Deux

Dori <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2003_03_30_archive.html#a003311">responds</a> to my earlier post with some good points.

Dori&#39;s an author and doesn&#39;t use her weblog as a professional outlet, therefore my criteria for a author/weblogger don&#39;t work in her case. Good point, and I&#39;ll say that being able to read her blog still lets me get to know her &quot;voice&quot;, and get to know her better. So I&#39;ll concede her point, and say that not every author is going to have a blog about their writing, but I&#39;d still like the author to have a blog of some sort.
