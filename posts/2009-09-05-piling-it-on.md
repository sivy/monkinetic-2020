[The Daily Exhaust](http://blog.thecombustionchamber.com/2009/09/iphone_owners_arent_new_years.html):

>*iPhone owners users integrate their iPhones into their lives*. They surf the web, check their GMail, Yahoo and thanks to Exchange integration, their work email. Not to mention downloading applications, music and videos [emphasis theirs].

Indeed. And those 60,000 different applications that iPhone users are downloading at a rate of, oh, [5.4 million](http://iphonetouch.blorge.com/2009/07/14/apples-app-store-surpasses-15-billion-downloads/) a day? Many of them are network-enabled, meaning that each new app downloaded gives users another reason to use AT&T's straining infrastructure.
