Title: David Hyatt on Gecko (Mirrored)
layout: post

<a href="http://jmtee.blogspot.com/">jmtee</a> has a <a href="http://jmtee.blogspot.com/2003_01_01_jmtee_archive.html#87297674">blog entry</a> where he mirrors some of <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/">David Hyatt</a>&#39;s (<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> team member) comments regarding why Apple went with KHTML over the Gecko rendering engine. David has since taken down his post, so there&#39;s some question as to why, but the stuff jmtee mirrored is insightful.
