Title: "Python+Conversant: What was I thinking?"
layout: post

I started seriously hacking on <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> last night. As I asked on #plex: &quot;why do we always start with the most complex project we can think of when learning a new language?&quot;<p>
Anyway, I started on a python library/wrapper for <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com">Conversant</a>&#39;s <a href="http://xmlrpc.free-conversant.com">xml-rpc API</a>. I&#39;ve started this project in 3 different languages now, and I never get any farther than the last time. I suspect the problem lies in my somewhat weak OO design skills - transmogrifying a procedural API to an OO one is not an easy task.<p>
This is no reflection on Conversant, BTW. Au contraire - Conversant&#39;s API is very OO considering the functional language it&#39;s built on. It&#39;s more the flattening nature of remote procedure APIs, and my own aforementioned weaknesses.</p></p>
