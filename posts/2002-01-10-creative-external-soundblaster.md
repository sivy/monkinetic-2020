Title: Creative External SoundBlaster
layout: post

Found on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">SlashDot</a>: an external <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/products/extigy/">SoundBlaster</a> box from Creative. Looks pretty cool. It&#39;s got a bunch of inputs (including midi, optical, two minis - device and mic, and more) and as many or more outputs, including 5.1 surround. Wow. Neat.
