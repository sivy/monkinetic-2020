I had previously helped create a set of client-project mailing lists and websites, and so then was asked to do the redesign.

Ivy Architectural Innovations&#39; president, Richard Ivy, wanted a design that was eye-catching and bold, while maintaining a measure of sophistication and professionalism. The design should not distract from the content of the site. I started with the Ivy Architectural logo, which was composed of a calligraphic signature and the words Architectural Innovations in Times Roman. We wanted to keep the signature, as it is used on all of Ivy Architectural&#39;s CAD drawings. We decided to move to a more contemporary sans-serif font for the logo, and took that idea into the rest of the design. The bold red draws the eye in to the section titles and navigation, while not overwhelming the larger white content area on the page.

On the Case Study pages, we replaced the red with a medium grey that still offsets the navigation, while not affecting the colors in the photographs that support each case study.
