No time to post. Imagine a blog post here about why Apple&#39;s core supporters are mystified and/or up in arms over the iPad, and a clever Venn diagram showing the overlap of professional designers, web designers, and unix-lovers; and a non-connected circle labeled &quot;everyone else&quot;. Then imagine a circle labeled iPad that completely surrounds &quot;everyone else&quot; and barely grazes the others. Discuss.
