Title: Use Cases
layout: post

I&#39;m working on a project where I&#39;ve been introduced for the first time to the &quot;proper&quot; methods of software design, and am being chained (well, ok, metaphorically) to my desk to write Use Case Scenarios. I have to tell you, there are few tasks more boring than writing Use Case Scenarios. &lt;yawn&gt;. The fact that i got up at 5:30 this a.m. and was in the office at 6:45 a.m. does not help.
