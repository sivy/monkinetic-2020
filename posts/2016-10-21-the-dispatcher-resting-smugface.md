[John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com)'s new audiobook-only story is out (and *FREEEEEEEE*)! [The Dispatcher](https://www.amazon.com/FREE-The-Dispatcher/dp/B01KKPH1NI) is *fantastic*, a short listen (~2 hours), and is narrated by The Other Spock [Zachary Quinto](http://www.zacharyquinto.com). It's really good, with an interesting core concept that is a pleasant departure from John's typical Sci-Fi fare.

> "Your face is always smug. You have resting smugface"

And dangit if Zach doesn't hit the narration out of the park. He brings each of the characters to life, subtle and unsubtle, whether noble, time-worn, or murderous. Can't wait to see (hear?) what else he ends up narrating.

(Resting Smugface is my next band name.)
