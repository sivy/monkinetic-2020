Well, I finished Neil Stephenson&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380973464/qid=1035932208/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5996147-3882535?v=glance">Crytonomicon</a>. It&#39;s a LONG book - 900 pages. It took me approximately 15 hours to read it - that&#39;s actual reading time, and it&#39;s an estimate since I generally read about 60 pages an hour, or a page a minute. That&#39;s not terribly fast (IMO) but it&#39;s pretty fast.

The book was really good, there are several people I&#39;m going to recommend it to. One is my geek kid brother, Sean, the other is Jodi&#39;s math-geek-military-consultant-analyst father.

I&#39;ve noticed something about myself and books. For about the first 75-80% of the book, I can usually put it down for extended periods to do other things. Once I cross that 80% threashold, everything else (sleeping, conversing with signifcant others, eating, that sort of thing) kind of loses significance in the face of <i>getting to the end</i>. I&#39;m generally ambivelent about this fact - I very much want to see what happens - but I also hate for the story to end. Either way, I simply must <i>finish the book</i>. Weird.
