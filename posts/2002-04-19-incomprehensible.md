<blockquote>If you ask me, there&#39;s nothing more unsettling than the idea that some person believes that blowing up others is so important that they willingly give their life in the process, and indeed, by design. That&#39;s a sort of nihilism and fervor that I&#39;m not really prepared to deal with psychologically.</blockquote>
