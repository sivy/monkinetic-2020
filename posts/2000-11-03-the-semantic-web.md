Title: The Semantic Web

[via &quot;Scripting News&quot;] Edd Dumbill on <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/11/01/semanticweb/index.html">The Semantic Web</a>. Semantic has to do with meaning - in this case, how various technologies are being used to encode the <i>meaning</i> of the web, thus making the web even more machine readable.

Why bother? When computers can parse out more of the meaning of the content on the web, they can help us extract more information about what&#39;s out there - making it easier to get it <b>here</b> - whever here may be.
