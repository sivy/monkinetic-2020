Jodi went running this morning. She&#39;s out there now, getting fit. We both need it - we&#39;ve been complaining of our lack of proper diet and exercise, and corrensponding lack of energy, for some time. My bike gets out of the shop today (after a much-needed tuneup) so I&#39;m going to start riding again.

Being out of work right now, I can&#39;t afford some of the extras I&#39;d like (like clipless pedals!) but it&#39;s going to feel <i>so good</i> to once gain teach my body who&#39;s boss. It&#39;s been in charge for far too long now.
