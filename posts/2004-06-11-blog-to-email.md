Title: Blog To Email
layout: post

Ok, one of the features that I had on my old site was a site mailing list. You could subscribe to the mailing list and get blog posts in your inbox. I&#39;ve had at least one person (you know who you are!) go on about how he would not subscribe to the <a href="http://redmonk.net/feed/rss2/">RSS feed</a> and wanted the mailing list functionality.

Well, I&#39;ve set up a monkinetic mailing list at the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/">Google Groups beta</a>. I&#39;ll be sending blog posts there, if you subscribe you&#39;ll get monkinetic posts via email. There is the added advantage of having a place for discussion as well.

Have fun!

Update: Ok, sorry. I&#39;ve changed my mind about the Google mailing list. Soon I&#39;m going to investigate running <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">mailman</a> here on my own server - I think I want more control over how the whole thing is done. Sorry for the inconvenience.
