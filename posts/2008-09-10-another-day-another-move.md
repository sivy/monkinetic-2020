Title: Another Day Another Move
layout: post

This time, it's moving this blog to Movable Type, the [afore-mentioned](http://redmonk.net/archives/2008/09/05/a-move-apart) *kick-ass blogging system*.

Ironically, I made this decision well before I knew I was going to be working for [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com). I've been doing some plugin work in MT and just grew to love the professional interface, powerful API, and overall sense of maturity the app has.

I'm not done with the move - there's a lot of detail work I want to do to the templates. I'm not going to try and duplicate the look completely, but I'm going to start morphing it over time as it really becomes the 10th iteration of this site (!!).

Thanks for reading, and I trust we'll have many more years together, dear Reader!
