I stood in line for two hours this morning and cast my vote in the 2016 general election. As [promised](/im-with-her.html), I voted for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine for President and Vice-President.

### Down-Ticket 

Down-ticket I voted a mix of Democrats and Republicans depending on local issues.

(I voted Republican in one race specifically because the other candidate was Libertarian, and that ship sailed a LONG time ago for me. [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)'s dystopian interpretation and realization of that philosophy hasn't helped their cause.)

Embarrassingly, this was the first time I sat down and read all the election prep documents that Arizona and Gilbert sent out, and Googled and researched various candidates for the local "non-partisan" elections. It's amazing what you learn, and it made me sign up for [permanent early voting](https://recorder.maricopa.gov/earlyvotingballot/permanentevlistinfo.aspx), even before I realized it would allow me to skip the two-hour wait at the early voting stations.

### Vote!

The polls are going to be nuts on election day, if (as I hope) voter turnout is good. If you are a legal voter in the United States (even if living out of the country) I hope you have made provisions to cast your ballot this year - our franchise is not something to give up lightly.

I've had family members and friends half-joke about whether their vote is going to "count" -- if their vote is not the same as mine, or if their preferred candidate does not win -- as if one's vote is only worth casting if it's a "deciding vote". Your vote absolutely counts, as [David Walbert explains](http://www.learnnc.org/lp/media/lessons/davidwalbert7232004-02/electoralcollege.html#4):

> ...every vote does count; it just counts in a more complicated way. When you vote for president, remember that you're voting in a state election, not a national election.

(Read that whole article, it's interesting)

No matter, what, the fact that we *can* vote and participate in this democracy is crucial. Get out and do it. The only way your vote stops counting is if:

1. You throw it away by not voting
2. [Candidates start deciding they're not going to honor the results](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/presidential-debate-highlights/).
