Title: Presidential Speech and Document Tag Clouds
layout: post

I&#39;m a little over the whole &quot;[tag cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud)&quot; (a simple weighted list, really) thing as applied to blog posts, but applying it to more socially &quot;interesting&quot; texts is a clever idea. Here [Chirag Mehta](http://chir.ag/) has run a series of tag clouds on 360 speeches and documents by Presidents of the United States - [US Presidential Speeches Tag Cloud](http://chir.ag/phernalia/preztags/).

For example, move the slider back and forth to move forward and back in time, and compare W&#39;s *2001-01-20: First Inaugural Address* with his *2006-01-31: State of the Union Address*. Pretty cool.
