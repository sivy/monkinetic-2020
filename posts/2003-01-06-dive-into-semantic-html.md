Title: Dive Into Semantic HTML
layout: post

<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark</a> is at it again, this time listing his posts <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/quotations/">by quotation</a>, by keying off the <code>cite</code> element of his <code>blockquote</code> and <code>q</code> tags.

Even though I occasionally <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/channel/semanticweb/2002/12/28#item1669">take issue</a> with Mark&#39;s attitude, I really like what he&#39;s doing, and like that he&#39;s showing another side of the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/channel/semanticweb">semantic web</a>, the one using the web&#39;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/" title="HTML">native tongue</a>.
