layout: post

My grandfather, Marion Richard Ivy, veteran of 3 wars (World War II, Korea, and Vietnam), retired teacher, master woodworker, hobbyist gemcutter, man-about-the-house, and all-around awesome grandpa, turns <strong>21</strong> today! Someone get that man a beer! :-)

Happy Birthday Grandpa!!
