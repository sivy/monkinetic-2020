Title: "TiVo & Podcasting III: Close But No Cigar"
layout: post

I've talked a good bit about [TiVo](http://redmonk.net/index.php?tag=tivo) on this site, and on my early forays into listening to podcasts on my TiVo by way of the TiVo Desktop software (most recent tivo+podcasting post [here](http://redmonk.net/archives/2004/11/14/tivo-podcasting-ii-getting-my-religion/)
).

Recently, TiVo added [podcasting](http://www.tivo.com/4.9.11.asp) support to it's software. This is a great step, though it's not perfect by any stretch. From my [first tivocasting post](http://redmonk.net/archives/2004/11/09/tivocasting/):

>I'd love to be able to setup a WishList that automatically downloads podcasts that match my keyword, participant, or producer search.

TiVo is going to need to partner with someone (a [Technorati](http://technorati.com/tag/podcast) or similar) in order to accomplish this level of integration, but until they do I think they're going to miss out on the kind of user interaction that their customers have come to expect.
