<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107946/">Ed Cone</a> has an <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107946/2003/06/18.html#a557">interview up</a> with <a href="http://www.house.gov/boucher">Rick Boucher</a>, smart guy Congress-dude from Southwestern VA.

I like Boucher, at least for his seeming common-sense approach to internet law. Glad to be a Virginian today!
