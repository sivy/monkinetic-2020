Ever want to just turn off that logger for a while in Python? Maybe while running tests or debugging? Even the CRITICAL messages?

Notice that the logging level contants (`logging.DEBUG` etc) actually represent [numeric values](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html#logging-levels):

    Level       Numeric value
    CRITICAL    50
    ERROR       40
    WARNING     30
    INFO        20
    DEBUG       10
    NOTSET      0

On a whim I tried:

    logging.getLogger('logger_to_turn_off').setLevel(100)

And *bam*, no logging, even the CRITICAL messages. Yes, most of you python nerds knew this, but I didn't, so *I* learned something at least!
