I took a step today I've never taken before: I called the offices of my 3 Republican representatives in Congress ([John McCain][mccain] and [Jeff Flake][flake] in the Senate and [Representative Matt Salmon][salmon] in the House) and asked them to speak out against the appointment of known white nationalists to the Whitehouse staff and Cabinet.

I was nervous - I've generally been a [lackadaisical][mw] citizen (to my shame) and this was a first step at real engagement. I used [Who Is My Representative][wimr] (kudos to the creators for a dead-simple single-purpose site) to find the names and contact information for each.

I also wrote a quick script for myself to help with nerves. I didn't use it verbatim but writing it out really helped:

> Hi, my name is Steve Ivy and I live in the [district, state].

> I'm calling to ask [member] to speak out against the President-Elect's appointment of white-nationalists like Steve Bannon to his staff and cabinet. This is not what our country should be about. I believe [member] has our [district, state]'s best interest at heart, and silence on this issue sends the wrong message to residents and members of marginalized groups here that he isn't watching out for *their* best interests.

I made sure to "click-through" to a staff member (the three I talked to sounded pretty harried) rather than leave messages. Senator Flake's staff person was clear that the Senator has received significant feedback on this issue from his constituents, so - ***go AZ***.
