Title: Fetchmail, procmail, SpamAssassin
layout: post

I&#39;ve got some time this evening, so I&#39;m going through the process of setting up fetchmail, procmail, and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/SpamAssassin.html">spamassassin</a> on my TiBook. (fetchmail and procmail come installed on OS X) <i>I hate SPAM</i>.

Update: It worked! I&#39;ve actually disabled my main pop account in Mail, and I&#39;m letting fetchmail do the work for me. For now Mail is still filtering mailing lists and stuff, but soon I&#39;ll get procmail to do that too, since procmail&#39;s rules are actually useful...
