Title: Removing the &quot;Clear Form&quot; button
layout: post

I think I&#39;ve going to remove the &quot;Clear Form&quot; button on Sid&#39;s interface. The longer a post I type, the more afraid I am of it - it&#39;s like that big, red, &quot;Do Not Push&quot; button - my mouse just starts drifts that direction...
