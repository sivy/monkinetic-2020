Title: Yay mod_rewrite, again
layout: post

I&#39;ve found some links to my content floating around the web of the form
<code><a href="http://www.redmonk.net/discussion/thread.html$msgnum=2353">www.redmonk.net/discussion/thread.html$msgnum=2353</a></code> So I decided to route them to the same script that maps some of my other old <a href="http://free-conversant.com">Conversant</a> URLs to the new site, and now the discussion-style links work after a fashion - they get <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3">302</a>&#39;d to the correct url - in this case <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2003/10/30/winter-lawn-redux">redmonk.net/archives/2003/10/30/winter-lawn-redux</a>.
