layout: post

Oh my, I was laughing my... patukas.. off reading this:

<a href="http://perversiontracker.com/archives/000076.html">Browsers in the Hands of an Angry God</a><blockquote>5. And the Internet Explorer, because he render the text, but implementeth not the tab, and render not the CSS; he is unclean unto you.</blockquote>
Scroll down for another bit in the comments:
<blockquote>3. And ladd spake: &quot;When you will slave for hours to design pages of your own, before your very eyes it shall look perfect in the software that is WYSIWYG.<br />
4. &quot;But verily, the crap browsers shall render the page as if it were the back of an ass, and the Windows users shall cry, &#39;It is broken, stupid Mac luser.&#39; And there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall ye know the lesson of this Scripture.</blockquote>
