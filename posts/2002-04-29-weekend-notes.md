Title: Weekend Notes
layout: post

Ah.. Sunday afternoon. Nice lazy day. Jodi and I had a really full Saturday: we got up at 5 o&#39;clock to go hiking at Squaw Peak. That about killed me, but I&#39;m getting better. Squaw Peak is about an hour hike to the summit, but it&#39;s all going up - with no respite, it&#39;s like climbing stairs. By the time I got to the top  I had almost vomitted, and my legs were so rubbery I about fell off the mountain (the top is all crags - you have to be  mountain goat to stay put!) The view, however, is awesome - you can really get an idea of how huge the Phoenix valley is.

Afterwards we had a church meeting over lunch. Then we went home and crashed for an hour or so (boy did we need naps!) Then we got up and worked around the house - I finished running the new coax cable from the wall in the guest bedroom, through the closet, over into the office closet, and to the cable modem and router. We finished cleaning up the office and set up the desk and the old Mac tower (Blue and White G3 for those who care).


Today after church we finally bought a lawnmower, and stopped  at the Chandler Fashion Center Apple Store, and bought a LaCie FireWire CD-RW drive. We needed a backup solution, which we&#39;ve been living without for 3 years. Also, Jodi is really getting into iTunes and iPhoto, and this drive will be seeing a lot of action. -)

Well, I&#39;m updating to Mac OS X 10.1.4 right now, so I have to reboot.
