Title: Jaguar Mail 1, Steve 0
layout: post

Well, I installed Jaguar today, and all was going well until I found out that Mail won&#39;t let me use the menu. It&#39;s the weirdest thing. No other apps seem affected, but in Mail clicking on the menu bar does nothing. This is not an acceptable state of things. :(
