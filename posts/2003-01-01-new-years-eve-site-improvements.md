Title: New Year's Eve Site Improvements
layout: post

As previously mentioned, I&#39;ve made some improvements to the site this evening. I&#39;ve added a link to this (<a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;monkinetic">monkinetic</a>) weblog to the section navigation; I also added a couple subscribe links to the discussion navigation, too (for the <a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/subscribing.html">mailing list</a> and <a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/recent.rss">rss</a>) to make it easier for folks to find out what&#39;s going on here. Enjoy!

And Happy New Year!
