Title: Reader Trends
layout: post

&gt;From your  169 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 3,640 items, starred 0 items, and shared 40 items.

Neat! [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader/) just added an [interesting trends page](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-like-big-charts-and-i-cannot-lie.html) that shows how often your feeds update, how many items you&#39;ve read, shared, and starred, and how many items from each of your feeds you&#39;ve read. I&#39;m using this information to do a year-start prune of my (previous to starting the prune) 200+ feeds. (Down to 140 at this point.)
