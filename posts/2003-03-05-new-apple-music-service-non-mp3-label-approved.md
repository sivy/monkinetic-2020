Title: New Apple Music Service - Non-MP3, Label-Approved?
layout: post

It looks like Apple <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=77&amp;ncid=738&amp;e=11&amp;u=/mc/20030304/tc_mc/apple_music_service_forthcoming_">may be announcing</a> shortly a new music service for Mac/iPod owners, using label-approved music and non-mp3 format. Argh.

Apple had so much going for it - the whole digital hub thing, iTunes, iPod. Do they know it was MP3 support that made iTunes so frikkin popular? I wonder if they will continue to support MP3? I guess we&#39;ll see what happens.
