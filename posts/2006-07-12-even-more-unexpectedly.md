Title: Even More Unexpectedly
layout: post

Friday before last, I said goodbye to [Content Connections](http://contentconnections.com) after 2.5 years. it wasn&#39;t my choice but there was no malice involved on either side. These decisions have to be made sometimes.

It&#39;s been a great time, working with a fantastic team of people, and some very smart IT guys. Rich - we nearly came to blows but it was worth it. You know I respect you, now stop playing [WoW](http://worldofwarcraft.com) and get back to work! ;-) Mike, how you ever put up with him is beyond me. You, too - turn off WoW and get Scalix in line. Scott - I do not envy you the headache you shall have when you awake. In the meantime, sleep well, and dream of Superman.

I signed an offer today that came about *very* quickly, and unexpectedly, after leaving Content Connections. More about that in the near future.
