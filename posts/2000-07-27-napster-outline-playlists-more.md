Title: Napster, Outline playlists, more
layout: post

In meetings all this week, and boy am I glad for the web.

Whether or not [these guys][1] get spanked today, our large library of tunes is really going to benefit from Userland&#39;s [new tool][2]. Outline playlists... mmmm. I hope it&#39;s cross-platform. [Dave responds][3]. Thanks, Dave!

Wow. my cross-platform question made it onto [Scripting News][4]. _Warm fuzzies!_  [Groupville][5] is a new groupware application from [Studio Sendai][6]. WebObjects. It would be great if they had an ASP version. _hmmmmmm._ via &quot;Stepwise&quot;.

I&#39;m a bit sick of the L&amp;F of this site. I want something simpler... but I hate to lose this template. I don&#39;t particularly want to make it a theme - no time. _what to do, what to do?_

The [WSJ][7] can kiss my ***. There&#39;s an enlightening article about [Napster][1] and intellectual property in the WSJ today. But you have to have a PAID subscription to access anything on wsj.com. I&#39;m not pointing anyone there. _Update_: Luckily, I don&#39;t have to - you can read the [article][8] at MSNBC.
