Title: Bow before the Internet Movie Database
layout: post

OK, you must know by now I am a movie junkie. I love movies. Jodi, my wife, is too. We love to chill in front of a new flick, or an old favorite. I discovered the <a href="http://www.imdb.com">Internet Movie Database</a> a couple years ago, but since getting our <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/images/modemAndRouter.jpeg">wireless network</a> in place, we hardly watch a movie or television without the TiBook nearby, open to imdb.com. Then we follow stars, co-stars, supporting actors, and cameos from whatever we&#39;re watching to wherever we saw them last, and beyond. A movie junkie&#39;s dream, indeed!
