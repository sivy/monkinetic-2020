Title: New Feedster, sponsored links, and *the other* Steve Ivy
layout: post

Well, shoot. I had finally kicked <a href="http://apps.heritagecoin.com/wordfromsteve.php">this Steve Ivy</a> off the first few pages of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=steve+ivy&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Google</a>,  now he (well, his company Heritage Coin) has purchased a well-placed sponsored <a href="http://www.heritagecoin.com/index_ov.asp?type=overture+steve+ivy&amp;target=steve+ivy">link </a>on the new <a href="http://feedster.com">Feedster</a>. Yeargh! Foiled again!

So, I just noticed that the other Steve Ivy is now #3 on Google after me. I must defeat him! If you&#39;re a blogger and care about me, help me in my fight to overthrow this... *other Steve Ivy* - link to this site with my name! ;-)
