Title: "A Rant: Dave, Omni, Outlining, and FUD"
layout: post

I&#39;m disappointed to see <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/04/25">Dave&#39;s immediate, and dire, warnings</a> against lock-in in reference to <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/">Omni&#39;s Outliner</a>.

<p>&quot;Users beware, one of the lessons of the last round in outlining is that you don&#39;t want your ideas locked up in a proprietary format. That&#39;s why MORE had lots of import/export capabilities. Before you commit to Omni, ask them to clearly state that your work won&#39;t be locked up...&quot;

<p>Has Dave investigated Omni&#39;s product at all? Outliner uses a MacOSX-native plist file format, completely text-based, that is basically a serialized struct. It isn&#39;t any less open than OPML (Dave&#39;s serialized outline xml format)- it&#39;s text based, can be parsed by any environment (even those without an xml parser! Oh my!)

<p>Dave has a definition of open, which means his format. <br />Sowing FUD is stupid.

<p>&quot;One more thing, be sure they have a good scripting interface. It&#39;s important.&quot;

Who is it important to? Does it ever occur to Dave that every user out there is not a scripter, or programmer, or would ever give a rip that their outliner has a scripting interface? Frontier, and Radio, are not the archetypal outliners. They *are* powerful products which have benefited
from the outlining paradigm, but to wave his hands and say &quot;Hey - watch out! Their product doesn&#39;t have scripting and an xml format - how can they do that!?&quot; is silly, and a dis-service to users.<p>

I just bought a copy of Omni&#39;s Outliner- paid $21.12 for the beta. It&#39;s a rock-solid product with a lot of features.

<p>Dave should lay off the hype, welcome Omni to the market, and see if there isn&#39;t something he can learn from them too.

BTW - Dave&#39;s aspersions are especially out of line for a company like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com">Omni</a>,
who have been writing <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/consulting/clients/"><i>great</i> software</a> for NeXTStep, OpenStep, WebObjects, and now MacOSX for over ten years.

<p>Omni&#39;s software is solid and innovative, they are <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/community/developer/mailinglists/">incredibly active</a> in the developer community (even though they are not the <a href="http://www.apple.com">platform vendor</a>).

P.S. Omni also <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/community/developer/sourcecode/">gives away</a> tons of source code - for the very frameworks that their products are built on.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
