Title: Republicans Land-mining Incoming Dems
layout: post

This is repulsive: [Republicans Set Obstacles for Incoming Democrats](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~3/57767679/republicans_set_obstacles_for_incoming_democrats.html), and I&#39;m ashamed I voted for anyone involved in this.

For better or worse, the people voted for the new Congress and these kinds of tactics should be seen as a slap in the face of the American People. Not only were the Republicans caught completely off-guard (inexcusably) by the public backlash over the war in Iraq and the conservative backlash over big-government spending, they are now being sore losers and making it as hard as possible for the incoming Congress to do what it was the people voted them in for.

It&#39;s going to be well nigh impossible *anyway* for the Democrats to live up to their campaign rhetoric (as for any politician - promising is easy, delivering is hard). The Republicans should be big about it and *respect* the people they claim to represent.

This especially burns me:

>The unstated goal is to disrupt the Democratic agenda and *make it harder for the new majority to meet its promise to reinstitute &#39;pay-as-you-go&#39; budget rules, under which new costs or tax cuts must be offset to protect the deficit from growing.* (emphasis mine)

Asumming (perhaps naively) that the legislation is as it appears, this kind of fiscal responsibility is *exactly what the Republicans should have been pushing for the last 12 years.* Shame on the GOP.
