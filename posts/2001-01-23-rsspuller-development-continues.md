Title: RSSPuller development continues
layout: post

Since things have been slow at work, I&#39;ve continued on development of the &quot;RSSPuller&quot;. It now reads RSS 0.91, 0.92, 0.92d2, and RDF 0.9 Simple. The code is also much better factored now, resulting in less debugging time. Thanks to the iDO Script scheduler, it&#39;s running (4 times successfully now!) every 30 minutes on my work machine.
