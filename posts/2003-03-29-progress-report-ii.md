*Whew*. You know how you sit there, looking at your working code, thinking &quot;I&#39;m so glad it works. It works really well! But... it could be better... I wonder if instead of a bitmap I could get <i>*resolution independent*</i> ouput?&quot;

Well, just stop. Go for a walk. Watch a movie. Whatever you do, do NOT take a few minutes to find that <a href="http://piddle.sourceforge.net">little bit of code</a> that will give you <i>*resolution independent*</i> output. Do NOT spend the little-less-than-an-hour it takes to convert your bitmap generating code over to, oh-goodness-it&#39;s-sweet-high-quality-PDF...

Do NOT sit for two hours trying to understand why someone thought it would be a good idea to have the drawing code work opposite the global coordinate system, leaving your cleverly written code to flounder while the oh-goodness-it&#39;s-sweet-high-quality-PDF output runs right off the page in a fit of un-coordinate-d rage...
