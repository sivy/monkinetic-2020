Title: "PodNews 3: Your iPod's best friend"
layout: post

Mmmm, an RSS news aggregator for your <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</a>.
<blockquote>... why not keep yourself amused on the bus by reading the latest headlines from your favourite news sites? ... Wouldn&#39;t it be great if you could put some of it on your iPod? We thought the answer was yes, and so PodNews was born. (<a href="http://www.clichesw.com/podnews/">link</a>)</blockquote>
I wondered when <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> introduced the iPod why it had such a generic name... I guess by now we know! Go Apple!
