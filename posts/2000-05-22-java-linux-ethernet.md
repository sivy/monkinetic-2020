Man. It&#39;s been toooooooo long. I&#39;m finally wrapping up the interminable freelance job, and I realized (actually my wife reminded me) that I haven&#39;t blogged here in ages. This had to be fixed!

I have, actually, been blogging some at <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/camblog/">another site</a> that some co-workers and I put together. I guess I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.pyra.com/">makers of</a> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">BLOGGER</a> by whose magic the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/camblog/">CamBlog</a> came to life one day. Yes, the CamBlog, affectionately titled &quot;GeekTV&quot;, is a combo-box of a weblog/webcam. It will soon be added to the template of this site, somewhere...

Speaking of BLOGGER, using it is a completely different experience from using &quot;Manila&quot;. It&#39;s more... technical. But very powerful in as far as it goes. Blogger does one thing well- Blogs. Manila is much more flexible- it&#39;s the CMS face to &quot;Frontier&quot;.

&quot;Josh&quot; has gotten &quot;XML-RPC&quot; working in Turbine, an apache/Java/Servlets thing. I&#39;m not sure I understand the recent proliferation of Apache/Java projects recently. <a href="http://java.apache.org/turbine/index.html">Turbine</a>, <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/index.html">Cocoon</a>, <a href="http://java.apache.org/jetspeed/site/overview.html">Jetspeed</a>, <a href="http://www.webmacro.org/">WebMacro</a>...

<a href="http://www.webmacro.org/">WebMacro</a> looks interesting. I wonder how it might compare to &quot;Frontier&quot;&#39;s template system? <i>In my mind, Frontier set the standard for seperating content and presentation in web systems.</i>

One thing Java needs to get before I can begin to build a truly great system in it: <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1132">persistent, structured storage</a>. Java could do it, but to be high performance, it would probably have to be native code and interface through JNI. <i>I bet the purists wouldn&#39;t like it.

I&#39;m just beginning to get interested in some of this Java+web+xml stuff. Gotta get some free time to explore. <i>Ha!</i>

Our home is a <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/the259diaries">90-year old Victorian</a>; we&#39;re slowly making plans to renovate this and that, knocking out some walls and adding others. <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/guide/networking/installation-1.html">This article</a> on Ars Technica looks like it&#39;ll be really helpful. With Macs in the bedrooms and Linux under the stairs, there&#39;ll be joy for everyone!
