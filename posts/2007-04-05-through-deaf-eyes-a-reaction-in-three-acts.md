(This is the content of a short reaction paper for [SLG 102](http://www.cgc.maricopa.edu/cgi-bin/curric.pl?crs=slg102), the sign language class Jodi and I are taking at Chandler-Gilbert Community College). Over the last two classes, we watched the recent documentary, [Through Deaf Eyes](http://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/).

"Don't hold me up now,<br>
I can stand my own ground,<br>
I don't need your help now,<br>
You will let me down, down, down!"<br>
