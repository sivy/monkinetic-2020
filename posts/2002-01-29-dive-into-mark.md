Title: Dive Into Mark
layout: post

<a href="http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/">This weblog</a> is really cool. Mark is really open about his <a href="http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/addiction">dealing with addiction</a>, and recently about <a href="http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/2002/01/26">the grief of losing someone he loved</a>. Hard stuff, but heartening to read.<p>
<i>In the midst of all this, today is my two-year anniversary of sobriety. Two years from today could be yours.</i><p>
Thanks Mark.</p></p>
