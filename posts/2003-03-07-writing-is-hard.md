Title: Writing Is Hard!
layout: post

BTW - I worked on the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkineticExtras/software/weblogs/2003/03/05/weblogGeneration.html">corporate weblog piece</a> for quite a while, tweaking it, taking out sections wholesale and gutting others to make it read better. Jim Roepcke and Robert Scoble were my guides, and I&#39;m super grateful for their thoughts and time.

I forget how hard writing is - I don&#39;t do a lot of longer bits, and this taxed the old brain cells more than I expected. But it was a good thing, and the process helped me think through my points much better than a short blog post would have.
