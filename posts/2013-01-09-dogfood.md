This site is now hosted on [markbox](http://www.markbox.io), my new Dropbox and Markdown blogging platform.

Markbox is running on Google's [AppEngine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), which is a pretty great platform, even with its warts. All posts are sitting in my Dropbox (in /Apps/markbox/posts/) and template files live in /Apps/markbox/templates.

I can post from [Mou](http://mouapp.com), my favorite OS X Markdwn editor, or (as I am now) from within the app itself. It's pretty much my ideal blogging platform right now (it should be, I wrote it :-) ) and I've got even more ideas coming.
