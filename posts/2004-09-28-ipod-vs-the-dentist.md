title: iPod vs. The Dentist
---

I had a dental appointment today, and (despite it's very low battery) decided to take the 'pod along to give me something to listen to behind the whine and grand of the drill. *Shudder*.

Surprisingly, the battery lasted all the way through the hour+ appointment, and I got to listen to some backlogged [Gilmor Gang](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail194.html) from [IT Conversations](http://www.itconversations.com/). Cool!

Despite the occasional requests and comments from the dentist, and the inevitable experiments in bone-conduction, I found that I was able to follow the show and it really made the time go by faster.
