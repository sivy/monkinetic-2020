Title: Working With Congress
layout: post

&gt;&quot;I sat in the Situation Room in secret meetings for nearly twenty years under five Presidents, and all I can say is that some awfully crazy schemes might well have been approved had everyone present not known and expected hard questions, debate, and criticism from the Hill

&gt;&quot;Working with the Congress was never easy for Presidents, but then, under the Constitution, it wasn&#39;t supposed to be. I saw too many in the White House forget that.&quot; - Bob Gates, current nominee for SecDef.
