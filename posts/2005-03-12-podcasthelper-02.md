Title: PodCastHelper 0.2
layout: post

I&#39;ve uploaded the lastest PodCastHelper. PodCastHelper is now a Mac OS X AppleScript application, so it should be much more efficient. I&#39;ve wrapped up some of the external calls so they won&#39;t throw a dialog up if they error out. Also, PCH now recognizes timecodes that start with &#39;#&#39;, so Christiaan Stoudt&#39;s <a href="http://homenetworkhelp.info">HomeNetworkHelp.info</a> podcasts work &quot;out of the box&quot;.

There may be a newer version soon. Requires <a href="http://growl.info/downloads.php">Growl 0.6.x</a>.
