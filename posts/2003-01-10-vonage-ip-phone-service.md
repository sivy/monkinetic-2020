Wow. <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> is <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/zapmail.html">shredding the telcos</a> and explaining the advantages of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).
<blockquote>A <a href="http://vonage.com/">Vonage</a> customer can make an unlimited number of unlimited-length domestic long distance calls for their forty bucks, with  call  waiting, call forwarding, call transfer, web-accessible voicemail and caller ID thrown in free.</blockquote>

The best part?

<blockquote>Cisco now manufactures an analog telephone adapter (ATA) with a phone jack  in the front and  an ethernet jack in the  back. The box couldn&#39;t be simpler,  and does exactly what you&#39;d expect  a box with a phone jack in  the front and an  ethernet jack in the back  to do. ... the ATA lets you use your phone as a phone, allowing new competitors to offer voice service over any high-speed internet connection. </blockquote>

I&#39;m assuming it only works for one phone. That would be ok if it were used for say, a business line. What if you want to replace all your phone service that way? (multiple phones in various rooms of the house)

Nevertheless, this is really cool!
