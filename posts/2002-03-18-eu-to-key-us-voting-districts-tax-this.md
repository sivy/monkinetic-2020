Title: "EU to key US voting districts: &quot;Tax THIS!&quot;"
layout: post

The Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,668543,00.html">reports on</a> a possible EU reaction to the steel tariff Bush imposed. They&#39;re likely to impose tariffs only on states and districts that are key to the Republicans this next election.

I&#39;ve never thought that the steel tariffs were a good idea, but I would like to see a side-by-side comparison of European trade practices vs. US trade practices. I confess to large ignorance, so I won&#39;t lambaste anyone yet.
