Hm. Dave is <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/11/26#When:9:07:37AM">re-inventing RSS&#39;s &lt;enclosure&gt; element</a>, this time as the technology-specific &lt;torrent&gt; element. We already have Bittorrent-as-enclosure working <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/11/18#041118_02">just fine</a>, thank you.
