Title: Between a rock and a soft place
layout: post

Jodi and I found a cool rock gym about 10 minuted from our house - it&#39;s also easy to get to from work so on my way home this evening I stopped by and bouldered for an hour or so. Oy! My poor noodle-soft arms! I am NOT in shape, and since Arizona has some of the best climbing in the US, I figured I better get back into shape.

BTW - I wanted to link to the gym, but their site is down it would seem. how about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:s6wiBKCoc00C:climbmaxaz.com/+&amp;hl=en&amp;start=1">this link</a> instead? <i>Google to the rescue again</i>.

Jim says (IM): &quot;make sure you stretch before you go to bed [...] bend your wrist and elbow in different extreme ways.&quot;

Um... ouch! ;-)
