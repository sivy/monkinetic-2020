Via <a href="http://creativebits.raszl.net/index.html">Creative Bits</a> (of course I <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/CreativeBits">subscribed</a>): Free stock photography from <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/">stock.xchg</a>. There&#39;s some very nice stuff here. The cool bit is that not only is the photography free, but you can <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/index.phtml?f=reg">register for an account</a> and upload your own photography. I haven&#39;t looked into it, but it would be awesome if stock.xchg supported <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Creative Commons licensing</a>.
