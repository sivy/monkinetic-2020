<a href="http://sid.redmonk.net">Sid</a> is a Mac OS X weblog client for the Conversant internet groupware product.



More information about Conversant can be found here:<p>

http://www.free-conversant.com

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>:<br />
1) You&#39;re running Mac OS X<br />
2) You have a site (conversation) at http://free-conversant.com (or you are running a conversant site hosted by Macrobyte).

Sid is in alpha testing and will be available for download soon.

<b>What Sid can do</b>:<br />
1) Post messages to your Conversant site. You&#39;ll need to know the zone name and conversation name. If you do not know these, you can post a message at http://support.free-conversant.com and the ever-helpful Conversant community will assist you.<p>

2) Optionally add the message to a weblog on your site. Manage your list of weblogs.<p>

3) Sid saves your connection document as a .conv file, and you can have multiple documents open at once. Each one will post to the conversation identified in the settings.<p>

4) If an error occurs, a sheet will appear detailing the error. There&#39;s an option to &quot;email error report&quot;. Click the button to launch/switch to Mail.app, add any comments you&#39;d like, and send it. I&#39;ll try to respond to bug reports quickly.<p>

5) Sid lets you add italic, bold, underline, resources, and links to selected text in your post via the keyboard and menus.<p>

More information will be available on the <a href="http://sid.redmonk.net">Sid website</a>. If you are a Conversant user on Mac OS X and would like to participate in beta-testing, you can <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">drop me a line</a> and I&#39;ll most likely get you in on it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
