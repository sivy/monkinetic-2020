Title: #p2p-hackers
layout: post

I had dinner recently with <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com">Wes Felter</a> while he was in Phoenix, and we got to talking about peer-to-peer technologies. It&#39;s been rattling around in my head ever since. Yesterday I was emailing with Wes and he suggested getting on #p2p-hackers on irc.openprojects.net. <p>
I finally found an irc client for Mac OS X (<a href="http://www.snak.com">Snak</a>) and got on. While there I ran into <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com">Aaron Swartz</a>, who in turn pointed me to the work he&#39;s doing in distributed information spaces (based on RDF-style tuples) in the <a href="http://www.plexdev.org">Plex</a>. Mmmmm, distributed RDF.</p>
