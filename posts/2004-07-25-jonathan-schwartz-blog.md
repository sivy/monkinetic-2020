Title: Jonathan Schwartz' blog
layout: post

Sun Microsystem&#39;s CEO, Jonathan Schwartz, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/">has a blog</a>. Now, I don&#39;t care a heck of a lot about what&#39;s going on at Sun, but I am enjoying hearing about life from Jonathan&#39;s <abbr title="Point Of View">POV</abbr>. Largely he&#39;s using the blog to address issues that are facing Sun these days, like <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040712#commodities_railroads_and_how_sun">how they are going to monetize Java</a>, or <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040721#competing_against_a_social_movement">how to compete with &quot;Free&quot; software</a>.

I&#39;m once again working for a company that 1) is not in the I.T. market itself, 2) has real ideas that are changing the way our clients do business (for the better, I might add) and 3) must compete in the marketplace; a company where what I do has a tangible, immediate effect on the success or failure of our clients. Sounds normal enough, I suppose, but it makes me enjoy opportunities to spend time chatting with our CEO (in a company of 30 people I can still do that fairly often), making sure that I know where we&#39;re headed and how we&#39;re going to meet the challenges we face on the way there.

Reading Jonathan&#39;s and <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">Mark</a>&#39;s blogs are kinda like that.
