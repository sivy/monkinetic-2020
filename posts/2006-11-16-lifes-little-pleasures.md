[Scott Adams](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/) just [got over the flu](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/11/small_pleasures.html):

>After several days of doctor-ordered bland food, I experienced "flavor" yesterday as if for the first time. "SWEET BABY JESUS, WHAT PLANET DID THIS PICKLE COME FROM?!!!!"

I didn't see the hand that reached inside my head and removed the wads of cotton, but suddenly I remembered that I have hopes and dreams. Excellent!
