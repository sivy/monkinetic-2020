Title: I'm not dead yet
layout: post

Well, yesterday Jodi and I <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/01/02#item1675">went hiking</a> with her cousins, Brady and Carly. This morning I got up and went <a href="http://www.az-fattire.com/trails/phoenix/desert_classic.shtml">mountain biking</a> with them. I&#39;ve not had this much cardio-vascular exercise in ages, and I&#39;m feeling it!

I did survive however, without throwing up and with only some calf muscle pain to show for it. And I&#39;m inspired to get back out and ride more - I&#39;ve *got* to get my heart and lungs back in shape! -)
