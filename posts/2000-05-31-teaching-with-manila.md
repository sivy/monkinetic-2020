[Manila Clipper](http://www.cs.strath.ac.uk/~duncan/frontier/manilaclipper.html#quoter) is really cool. So is Manila Quoter. Both can be found [here](http://www.cs.strath.ac.uk/~duncan/frontier/manilaclipper.html#quoter).

Web geek and proud of it: I just ordered a [www sticker](http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/bazaar/mart/cart.cgi?action=view&amp;type=item&amp;itemid=31b3) today. anyone having spent time in Europe will know where I'm from!

I totally want [one of these](http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/bazaar/mart/cart.cgi?action=view&amp;type=item&amp;itemid=31cf).

Over in Wes's (Hack The Planet's) [discussion group](http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/), David McCusker and several other people I'm growing to highly respect are making that DG a daily lurk for me. I am in awe of these minds.
