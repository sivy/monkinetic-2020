<p><a href="http://www.soundopinions.com/">Sound Opinions - Listen Critically</a>
- I can&#39;t find now where I got a link to these guys, but Sound Opinions
is a rock and roll *talk show* (sweet!) on Chigago Public Radio. It&#39;s excellent,
geeky stuff, and it&#39;s a nice antidote to most music radio.</p>

<p>Particularly good (and this was the topic of the aforementioned lost link) was the show with producer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Brion">Jon Brion</a>, who demonstrates on piano a fascinating comparison between Nirvana&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_%28song%29">Lithium</a>&quot; and Gershwin&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someone_to_Watch_over_Me_%28song%29">Someone To Watch Over Me</a>&quot;.
