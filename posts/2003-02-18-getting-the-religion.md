Title: Getting the religion
layout: post

Looks like Microsoft and the PC vendors are getting the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/17.html#a2270">Newton religion</a>. Right on. Too bad Apple doesn&#39;t.

BTW - Steve Jobs may have his Reality Distortion Field, but Microsoft always does one better. They may <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/14.html#a2236">hog-tie</a> their evangelists with NDAs, but everyone can see they&#39;re <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/16.html#a2265">about to burst</a> for not being able to say anything. That&#39;s powerful juju.

For once I&#39;d like to see Apple giving developers the Full Tour of Apple&#39;s labs. I don&#39;t care even if everyone&#39;s NDA&#39;d to kingdom come - I want to know that Apple is doing cool stuff and that developers/MVPs/I-don&#39;t-care-who is about to burst for not being able to talk about it. Apple has a serious PR problem - always has - and The Steve makes it worse because he still has a hard time giving the customer what they want instead of what he wants. I&#39;m not going to run out and switch, but I mourn the missed opportunities.

If Steve Jobs had given the <a href="http://www.splorp.com/newton/">Newton</a> a tenth of the attention he gave the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac">iMac</a>, no one would be <a href="http://www.tabletpctalk.com">talking about the TabletPC</a> right now.
