Title: Truer Channels
layout: post

Seth&#39;s been busy - he recently added channels (sort of like customizable &uumlaut;ber-categories in <a href="http://free-conversant.com">Conversant</a>) for people he blogs about, including one for <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/index/channel/SteveIvy">Steve Ivy</a> - neat! If he&#39;s mentioned you and there&#39;s a category for your name, you can also subscribe to a <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/index/rss/channel/steveivy">vanity feed</a> (linked on the channel page).
