Jodi&#39;s at Macworld, so I&#39;m chilling at home tonight, enjoying rented entertainment. The score so far:<p>

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0232500">The Fast and the Furious</a>: How about &quot;lost cash from the curious&quot;? C+ at best. The lead character, the detective, is... how should I say it... think Keanu without the charm and depth.  Killed 1/3 of the way through.<p>

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0227445">The Score</a>: Still going, jury out. Good so far, at... 35%.</p></p>
