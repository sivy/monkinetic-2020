Title: 21 Things I Want in a Lover Handheld Communications Device
layout: post

With heartfelt apologies to Alanis:

* Fits in a normal-sized pocket
* A distinct absence of Windows(tm)
* A navigation system based in user-experience reality
* Able to use a wifi connection for data *and* voice traffic when available
* Able to run, quickly, an appropriately standards-compliant web browser
* Likewise an email client
* Likewise some form or news/rss reader
* Likewise a multi-protocol IM client
* Has a decent camera (~2mp for mobile pics)
* Might as well play real music
* And video, since it&#39;s MY list
* A bright, 720 x 480 (or better) resolution screen
* Sync all applicable content (contacts, feeds, bookmarks, music, video) with my *Macs* (Yes, more than one)
* Bluetooth 2.0, compatible with Bluetooth keyboards &amp;/or mice
* Capable of being managed with one hand for non-data-entry tasks
* Have a *usable* keyboard/thumbboard for data-entry/web/email/IM
* Some form of presence management (busy/away/available/driving)
* Is a Quad-band phone, since you never know where you&#39;r going to be
* Multi-tasking capable (my rss reader, IM, and email better be able to work simultaneously)
* A decent speaker so that my alerts (incoming call or otherwise) are crisp even when not loud
* *Is itself a work of nearly indescribable beauty*
