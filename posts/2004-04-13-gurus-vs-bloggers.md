Title: Gurus vs. Bloggers
layout: post

<a href="http://www.designbyfire.com">Design by fire</a>: <a href="http://www.designbyfire.com/000076.html">Gurus vs. Bloggers</a>, in which the sites of the web usability gurus and the sites of popular bloggers are judged head-to-head.

The results hardly surprise me. The bloggers may not be &quot;internationally recognized usability gurus&quot; but they have a couple large advantages:
<ol>
<li>They <i>use</i> their own sites on a daily basis. I doubt Neilsen or Norman are up to their elbows in the NN/g site every day.</li>
<li>Bloggers (esp. the popular ones) have a constantly running focus group with a built-in feedback loop: readers, their blogs, and the blogger&#39;s comment form. If something on the site sucks, the blogger hears about it.</li>
</ol>

I&#39;m sure a more complete analysis of the contest could be made, but these are some initial thoughts.
