[via &quot;Slashdot&quot;] What do you get when CBS engineers, Carnegie-Mellon professors, and a bunch of Mitsubishi robotics geeks get together?

A whole &#39;nother Superbowl, baby.

USAToday <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/super/2001-01-23-matrix.htm">reports</a> on CBS&#39;s &quot;EyeVision&quot; system, which uses 33 cameras mounted on robotic arms to capture Matrix-style 270-degree live video footage of the Superbowl action. I doubt we&#39;ll actually see <i>any</i> refs on the field in 3 years.
