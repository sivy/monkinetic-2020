layout: post

I&#39;ve been reading Terry Pratchett&#39;s <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/catalog/pratchett/site/books/description.asp?isbn=0061031321">Thief Of Time</a>, a light fantasy-sci-fi in the vein of Douglas Adams&#39; <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/hhgg.html">H2G2</a> series or Terry Brooks&#39; <a href="http://www.terrybrooks.net/novels/index.html">Magic Kingdom</a> series, and really enjoying it. If that&#39;s your bag, do check out Pratchett&#39;s Discworld books. (3.5 out of 5 whatevers).
