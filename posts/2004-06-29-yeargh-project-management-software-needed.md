Title: Yeargh. Project management software needed
layout: post

Ugh. I&#39;ve just surveyed a small portion of the <abbr title="Linux Apache MySQL PHP">LAMP</abbr> project management software world, and boy, is it in sad shape.

We need a temporary solution that will allow several project managers and a number of employees to:

<ol>
<li>Track projects with a fairly comprehensive list of milestones</li>
<li>Check off milestones as completed</li>
<li>Ideally has a bookmarkable report of projects filtered (or at least sorted) by milestone</li>
</ol>

Also of course it would have the usual bits like users/groups, etc.

I don&#39;t really need:

<ul>
<li>Billing or cost estimating</li>
<li>Time tracking</li>
</ul>

I want something that is relatively intuitive (and I&#39;m looking at Open Source? I know, I know...) and can be expained in 10 minutes. We&#39;re using PHP and MySQL in house, though I&#39;m not married to PHP in this case. Installation needs to be easy, and configuration should ideally be web-based.

If any of you good readers have a suggestion, please comment or ping me at steve at contentconnections dot com. Thanks!!
