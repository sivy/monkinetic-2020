Title: It's not catching on
layout: post

Clark was asked to write up a report on the status of the various intranet/website efforts in his anesthesiology department. <a href="http://www.romanvenable.net/202">In his words</a>, &quot;it&#39;s not catching on&quot;.

Figuring out how to move users into new ways of working is hard work. Lately I&#39;ve been brainstorming with my wife, who is fairly technical but not a geek by any means, how to explain the benefits of web publishing systems like Conversant to the lay person. It&#39;s not easy - I&#39;ve tried and I know Clark&#39;s frustration.
