Title: VidMoBlogging? ENG, please.
layout: post

<a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/000804.html">VidMoBlogging</a> by any sane name is still <acronym title="Electronic News Gathering">ENG</acronym>. Electronic News Gathering is a term that came in with the advent of portable video cameras, which meant a news crew could go out into the field, easily grab video and audio of a news event, and bring it back for editing, either physically, or, later on, via satellite.

What many are calling MoBlogging is really a personal combination of ENG and  OpEd. Which is really cool.

But please... &quot;VidMoBlogging&quot;?
