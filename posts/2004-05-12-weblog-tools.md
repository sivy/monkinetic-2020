Title: Weblog Tools
layout: post

Mark Ghosh posted <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2004/05/11/the-tools-of-my-trade/">his list of web dev tools</a>, and invited us to do the same, so here goes:

####Blog: Wordpress
This site is hosted by <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, a nifty PHP weblog tool that is easy to setup and run.

####Text Editor: <a href="http://www.barebones.com">BBEdit</a>
The text editor of discerning webmasters since the mesozoic era of the web. It doesn&#39;t suck.

####Computer: 17&quot; Powerbook &amp; Mac OS X
Courtesy of my employer, <a href="http://www.contentconnections.com">Content Connections</a>, an almost completely Mac-based company of 25 or so. Joe, you rock!

####SSH: Terminal or iTerm
My OS has ssh built in. Nyah nyah, Mark. :-)

####IRC: Colloquy
<a href="http://www.colloquy.info">Colloquy</a> is the coolest IRC client on the planet. Bar none.

####Email: Mail
Apple&#39;s Mail app, included with OS X. It works, and the spam filtering is good enough.

####Graphics: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator
I use Photoshop almost exclusively for web design. Illustrator I use for the occasional logo-ish bit of artwork or print-focused work.

Ok, that&#39;s my list. What&#39;s yours?
