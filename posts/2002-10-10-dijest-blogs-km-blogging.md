diJEST: a journal of extranpreneurial strategry and technology headlines (<a href="http://dijest.com/aka/categories/klogs/">link</a>)

diJEST is blogging about the practice of using blogs as an intranet/knowledge-management tool. I&#39;m considering a position as a content person for a large corporation&#39;s intranet. I don&#39;t know much about the position yet, but it seems to me to be a prime target for some blog-enhanced knowledge management.

<a href="http://dijest.com/aka/categories/klogs/">diJEST/klogs</a> seems a good site to start following - I&#39;ve added it to my NetNewsWire feeds.
