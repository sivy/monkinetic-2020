Title: Where do I stand?
layout: post

I&#39;ll be voting Republican tomorrow, but I&#39;m interested in some of the things the <a href="http://www.libertarian.org/">Libertarian Party</a> has to say.

<a href="http://www.libertarian.org/">Libertarian.org</a> looks like a good resource for reading up on the party - they have platform information, history, and other info. I don&#39;t agree with some of their ideas - but I&#39;m going to do some reading.
