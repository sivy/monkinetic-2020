Title: Sid 0.8.0 ready for alpha soon
layout: post

Well, it&#39;s been a long road, but the next version of Sid is going to go alpha soon. I can&#39;t believe it, myself. After being out of work for several months now I finally decided to get myself back into some Cocoa development - Sid being a priority.

So what&#39;s new? Well...
<li>Spellchecking in the post form.</li>
<li>A completely overhauled layout, including a settings panel that actually makes sense.</li>
<li>The ability to post from the Preview panel.</li>
<li>The ability to select which weblog in the Conversation to post to.</li>
<li>A major launch speed improvement, due to the fact that this version of Sid is all OS X native Objective-C - no JRE to launch.</li>
<li>I&#39;m using Apple&#39;s WebServicesCore API now, which <i>should</i> minimize API changes in the future (hey! I can dream...)</li>
<li>A clever new About box!</li>
