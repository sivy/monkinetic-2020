Title: "More Reading: The Visual Language of Experts in Graphic Design"
layout: post

Though a programmer/architect  by day, I actually have a degree in Graphic Design, and had the pleasure of working with some extremely good designers in my early career. So I&#39;m adding <a href="http://lieber.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/Lieberary/Graphic-Design/Expert-Design/Expert-Design.html">The Visual Language of Experts in Graphic Design</a> to my reading list. Fascinating so far.
