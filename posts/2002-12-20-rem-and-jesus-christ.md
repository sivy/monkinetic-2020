Title: R.E.M. and Jesus Christ
layout: post

I got my R.E.M. Fan Club Holiday Single today. It features two tracks, one of which is an actual Christmas song of unknown origin, called <u>Jesus Christ</u>. The other is called <u>No Matter What</u>.

I&#39;m curious as to the origin of the Christmas song, <u>Jesus Christ</u>. Mike Mills (R.E.M.&#39;s bassist) sings lead on it. I&#39;m posting the lyrics below, and I&#39;m attaching the mp3 of it to this message.

<blockquote>
<b>Jesus Christ</b><br />
Angels from the realms of glory<br />
The stars shone bright above<br />
Royal David&#39;s city<br />
Was bathed in light of Love

Jesus Christ was born today<br />
Jesus Christ was born<br />
Jesus Christ was born today<br />
Jesus Christ was born

And lo they did rejoice<br />
Strong and pure of voice<br />
And the wrong shall fail<br />
And the right prevail				</blockquote>					It has a sort of 60&#39;s folk feel to it - I could imagine Dylan or some such person singing it. If anyone recognizes it, I&#39;d love to know the origin of the song!
