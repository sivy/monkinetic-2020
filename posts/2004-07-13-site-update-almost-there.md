Title: "Site update: almost there"
layout: post

Well, I&#39;ve *almost* got my import script working well enough to push the button on getting 1729 posts from my blog archives imported into WordPress. It&#39;s been hairy, parsing 2400 or so xml files, creating posts and comments from them, and creating the connections between them all. Seeing as it&#39;s past midnight and I&#39;m pretty tired, I&#39;m not going to run the script on the live site until I&#39;m certain it&#39;s right, but I&#39;m hoping that will be sometime later today. This will mean I&#39;ve got all my content from June 2000 until the present. I have one more database of posts from late 1999 through June 2000 still to do.
