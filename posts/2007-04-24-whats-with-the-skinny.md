Title: What's with the skinny?
layout: post

No, my site is not fixed width and skinny because I could not bear to once again navigate the misted, tortured, dragon-infested waters of flexible web layouts. No, it&#39;s because I can [reach 95% of my audience](http://www.baekdal.com/reports/actual-browser-sizes/) with a site that is 768px wide. Yeah.
