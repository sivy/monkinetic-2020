Title: Scoble on HTTP Business Services
layout: post

Hmm. <a href="http://scobleizer.ManilaSites.Com/discuss/msgReader$311">Robert Scoble is touting HTTP Business Services</a>. &quot;His company is being kept afloat by building HTTP Business Services inside corporate firewalls. Makes sense, actually. Businesses have the money to spend on improving their processes and information systems.&quot;<p>

Um, Scoble? As Dave would say, we have a word for HTTP Business Services already - &quot;intranet&quot;. It works very well. (The word that is - YMMV on your intranet itself.)</p>
