Title: Lighting U2
layout: post

<a href="http://www.yourblueroom.com">Your Blue Room</a> has an awesome, if somewhat technical, <a href="http://www.yourblueroom.com/media/010803_lighting_dimensions.html">article about the visual production</a> of U2&#39;s Elevation tour.<p>
Jodi and I saw the show in DC at the Metro center, and I can vividly recall each effect discussed in the article. As all good shows go, I didn&#39;t think much about the lighting during the show, but am amazed now to see what goes into it all.
