Title: Brain idling, blogging TWIT
layout: post

The recent [TWIT](http://www.twit.tv/92) was good, especially if you&#39;re a massive geek, or really really really bored. I used to listen to the [Gillmor Gang](http://gillmorgang.podshow.com/) fairly regularly, and frankly I just wasn&#39;t entertained. [Leo](http://gillmorgang.podshow.com/) and his rotating crew of miscreants are alternately hilarious, self-deferential, pompous, very occasionally crude, and even more occasionally informative. :-)
