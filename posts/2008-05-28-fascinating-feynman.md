Title: Fascinating Feynman
layout: post

I have no idea how to categorize this post from longnow.org about [Richard Feynman](http://www.longnow.org/views/essays/articles/ArtFeynman.php), a fascinting and personal look at one of the giants of modern physics. Find yourself 20 minutes of pressure-free time and read it, then read it again.
