Title: Marching Penguin Feet
layout: post

Adelina and I went to see [Happy Feet](http://www2.warnerbros.com/happyfeet/) last weekend... the movie was really good (if a bit preachy towards the end), but I wish that Adelina had been able to see the real penguins in [March of the Penguins](http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/) first. Luckily, it came on TV this weekend and we were able to TiVo it, so she got to see it while the other was still fresh in her mind. We all enjoyed the movie, though we decided that emperor penguins, while being cute and fuzzy as chicks and fun and funny as adults, lead a life that we&#39;re glad we don&#39;t.
