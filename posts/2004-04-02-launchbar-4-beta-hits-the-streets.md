Title: LaunchBar 4 Beta hits the streets
layout: post

Woohoo!! The first Beta of the new LaunchBar is out, and it&#39;s a doozy! It has a ton of features the author of <a href="http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/archives/quicksilver_vs_launchbar.php">this articlee</a> found lacking, in that clean, unobtrusive interface I&#39;m come to love and depend on.

Way to go, <a href="http://www.obdev.at/">OBDev</a>!
