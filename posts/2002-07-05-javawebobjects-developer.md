Title: Java/WebObjects Developer
layout: post

Due to circumstances beyond my control, I am now available for Java/WebObjects work. I also have some experience in J2EE/Servlets, and a degree in Graphic Design. I&#39;ve been developing websites in a number of environments since 1996, and have worked with clients to help them define their needs and requirements.

You can find my resume <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/resume">here</a>. Please <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">email me</a> if you have questions, or are interested in my services.
