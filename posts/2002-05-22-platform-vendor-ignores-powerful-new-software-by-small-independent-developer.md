Title: Platform vendor ignores powerful new software by small independent developer
layout: post

Our <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">favorite platform vendor</a> has managed to completely ignore the release of an <a href="http://conversant.macrobyte.net/">incredibly powerful server product</a> for their platform, one which will drive sales of their platform, and will go far to show the power and flexibility of the platform.

Ironically, in the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/22#heyAppleHasDevelopers">vendor&#39;s own words</a>: &quot;small commercial developers <i>exist</i>. This has been a big outage for quite a few years.&quot;

More  irony: &quot;Sometimes small developers break through where the platform vendor is clueless. I&#39;ve seen it happen.&quot;
