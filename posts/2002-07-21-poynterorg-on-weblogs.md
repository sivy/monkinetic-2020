Title: Poynter.org on Weblogs
layout: post

[via Jim] Poynter.org has <a href="http://www.poynter.org/centerpiece/weblogs/weblogs.htm">an
article</a> about different kinds of weblogs and the uses they can be
put to in the corporate or news world.

I had a thought about weblogs and newspapers. Newspapers could host
weblogs, then run an (at least) internal aggregator. Make it easy for
users to blog articles from the newspaper, then let editors use the
aggregator to find content for the editorial page.
