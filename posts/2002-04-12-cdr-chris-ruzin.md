I was looking through my referer logs today, and noticed a new entry: turns out it&#39;s a new blog by an old buddy - <a href="http://www.mantis-design.com/personal/">Chris Ruzin</a> is another designo-geek I knew back in my days in Germany. Looks like he&#39;s back in the states and looking for work: if you need such a one as him, check out his <a href="http://www.mantis-design.com/personal/resume.php3">resume</a>.
