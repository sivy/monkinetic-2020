Title: ISSN - The latest rage
layout: post

Ok, I&#39;m a lemming - along with dozens of other weblogs, I&#39;ve <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/issn/ISSN.html">submitted an application</a> for an ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) (like an ISBN but for serials) for &quot;Redmonk.Net&quot; as an online serial publication. Man, That&#39;s cool.
