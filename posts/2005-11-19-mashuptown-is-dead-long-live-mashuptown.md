Title: Mashuptown Is Dead. Long Live Mashuptown
layout: post

A while back <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2005/07/22/mashuptown/">I blogged</a> about Mashuptown, the awesome site and podcast that has been showcasing mashups (two unrelated songs mixed together in some clever way) for the last, oh 8 mos, or so.

Recently Art <a href="http://viprhealthcare.typepad.com/mashup_of_the_week_podcas/2005/11/mashuptown_is_d.html">announced</a> that Mashuptown is closing it&#39;s doors, and taking down all the music it&#39;s been hosting. This is a real shame, and is probably due to some (heh - I first typed &quot;sue&quot; there - Freudian slip?) cease-and-desist letter from the usual suspects.

Art was kind enough to stop by a while back and <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2005/07/22/t-2-days/#comment-2852">wish Jodi and I well</a> in our process to adopt Adelina. I wish Art the best of luck, and hope that there are more mashups in his future!
