... but then everything will be ok. Yes, I&#39;ve changed the L+F again on redmonk.net - I&#39;ve been playing with a new CSS-based layout over <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/blog">here</a>, and decided that I was never going to get the whole site changed over until I put it out where people would see it, therefore bugging me into fixing any bugs and making templates for the rest of the site.

So... sorry if this just trashed your view of redmonk.net. If it did, *please* send me a screenshot and let me know what borwser and version you are using. I apologise for not having all the support necessary for the various browsers, yet. Give me time. -)
