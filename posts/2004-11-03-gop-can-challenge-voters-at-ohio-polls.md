<blockquote>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/politics/campaign/02cnd-ohio.html?ex=1257138000&amp;en=efd4b20998a7a771&amp;ei=5090">G.O.P. Can Challenge Voters at Ohio Polls, Court Rules</a>. In a day of see-sawing court rulings, a federal appeals court ruled early today that the Republican Party could place thousands of people inside polling places to challenge the eligibility of voters, a blow to Democrats who had argued that those challengers would intimidate minority voters.</blockquote><blockquote>So it comes down, again, to judges who were appointed by Republicans. This is not a good start to Election Day.</blockquote>

If I heard <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> correctly, the court allowed <em>1</em> person from each party inside the polling places. 1 Rep., 1 Dem. I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t see how this is intimidation.
