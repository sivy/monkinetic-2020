This afternoon I registered, along with Jodi, for the <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com">MacWorld Expo</a> in San Fransisco. Wooooohooooo!!! I have always wanted to be at one of these events. So, Jan 9th through the 14th we&#39;ll be on the left coast, checking out San Fransisco and all that&#39;s new in the Mac Universe. ;-)

To document the trip, I&#39;ve created a new <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/mwsf2001/">MWSF 2001</a> section on the site, as well as a <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/mwsf2001/">weblog</a>, of course! In time, the MacWorld Expo section will get it&#39;s own template, with links to interesting tidbits as I see fit.

If anyone is going to be at MW, post a response to <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/257">this message</a>, and let&#39;s set up a time to meet and greet! All are welcome!

P.S. - I apologize, the weblog link is currently broken. Please be patient.

P.P.S. - Thanks to Flip from &quot;Macrobyte&quot;, my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/mwsf2001/">MWSF weblog</a> is now fixed!
