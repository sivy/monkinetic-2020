Title: Intellectual Property
layout: post

<a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes Felter</a>&#39;s <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss">discussion group</a> is one of the most intellectual pieces of &#39;net property I visit. I only lurk, as I honestly don&#39;t always follow everything that&#39;s said there. Folks to listen to: <a href="http://swartzfam.com/aaron/">Aaron Swartz</a>, <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm">David McCusker</a>. David&#39;s mind especially is incredibly dense. And I mean that in the nicest way - his brain, as visualized on the intellectual space-time-continuum would be like a black hole. Warning: David&#39;s weblog is a journey through a mind <i>that does not work like yours</i>.
