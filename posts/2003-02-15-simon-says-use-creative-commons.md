<div style="float:right"></div><a href="http://www.lumacode.com/simon/index.html">Simon Extreme</a> is a Mac OS X &quot;reinterpretation&quot; of the classic Simon game. Interestingly, Simon Extreme is shipped under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0">Creative Commons license</a>, and <a href="http://www.lumacode.com/simon/developer.html">source code</a> is available. As if that&#39;s not enough, the designer of the interface, Rich of <a href="http://www.richd.com">Richd.com</a>, is making available some <a href="http://www.lumacode.com/simon/SimonGraphics.dmg">sample Photoshop files</a> of the interface, so that GUI designers can see how the interface was built up. Classy stuff.
