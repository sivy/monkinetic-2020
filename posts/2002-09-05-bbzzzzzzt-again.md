Title: BBzzzzzzt! Again.
layout: post

I just got my umpteenth rejection letter in my (now 11 week long) job search. This was for a job that I felt *really* good about. A job I was (by their own admission) over-qualified for. A job where the interview was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t know at this point what else I could have done. This is so frustrating.
