This is really cool - a map that can show which states each presidential candidate won, visually weighted by the number of electors for that state. It gives a better picture of how evenly divided our nation is, a fact blied a bit by the normal geographic view. To see the weighted map, click on &quot;Electoral Votes&quot; when the map loads.
