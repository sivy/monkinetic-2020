Title: "Up for air: Avoiding being over-McCuskered"
layout: post

I can&#39;t read more then 1/3 of the material on David McCusker&#39;s <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm">weblog</a> without coming up for air. It&#39;s like being in a parallel dimension, it seems very like our world, but it very much is not. I should add I admire (or at least am greatly intrigued by) Dave a lot.

<p>&quot;This is David McCusker&#39;s weblog. That rumor that I&#39;m a
two-headed mutant is false.&quot; <i>Don&#39;t be so sure. And don&#39;t piss off Vex.</i></p>
