Title: R.E.M. Unplugged on MTV2 Last Night
layout: post

Our local stations carry MTV2 on a high UHF channel. So I was, luckily enough, able to catch a re-broadcast of MTV&#39;s recent Unplugged with R.E.M. It was, as usual, a treat - although Michael Stipe seemed bored for the first few songs. Highlights:<p>
<i>Cuyahoga</i>: Awesome, beutiful song from Life&#39;s Rich Pageant, 1986. It&#39;s haunting live, and Michael finally began spending emotional energy while singing it.<p>
<i>Country Feedback</i>: Slow, powerful. From Out Of Time, (1990 I think). Michael has thrown himself into this song everytime I&#39;ve heard him perform it - &quot;I... <b>need</b> this...&quot;<p>
When MTV put up the Losing My Religion video on the screen behind the band, and Michael saw himself: &quot;Who is this guy? Get him off there.... God, he&#39;s so sincere!&quot;<p>

All in all a good time. These guys rock.</p></p></p></p>
