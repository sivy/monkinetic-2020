Title: Wait Wait!
layout: post

Jodi and I have tickets to tonight&#39;s taping of <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/">&quot;Wait, Wait, Don&#39;t tell me!&quot;</a> in Tempe, AZ, our new home town.<p>

WWDTM is a news quiz show on <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>, of which Jodi and I are both fans (NPR that is). The show will run this Saturday. I&#39;m totally stoked about this! If I&#39;m really lucky maybe I can get on as a contestant. <p>

Then again, most of the news I get these days is from web sources, as opposed to the mainstream media - so I may be a bit behind on current events. What are they talking about these days?</p></p>
