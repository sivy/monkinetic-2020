Title: TBL on Webizing Python

Tim Berners-Lee at the <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-pyth7.html">10th International Python Conference</a>:

>His proposal created a native graph data type that looked a bit like dictionaries, but allowed for storage of triples to represent a graph. He proposed a syntax like:

    `x = {sky color blue,gray; madeof air. sea color grey. gray sameAs grey}`

>From the above, we would have five arcs: sky color blue, sky color gray, sky madeof air, sea color grey, and gray sameAs grey. We would then be able to perform simple queries on the graph.

This would be really cool to see - languages beginning to adopt the high-level concepts that will make it easy for developers to express complex information efficiently.
