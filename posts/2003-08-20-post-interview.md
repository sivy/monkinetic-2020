*Whew*. Well, my interview skills are rusty. Thanks for all the well-wishes from friends and family.

I think that I did ok, but my nerves left me dry-mouthed and talking faster than I would have liked. Nothing to do about it now I guess. I liked the manager and team members I interviewed with, and I&#39;m hoping for a call-back for the next phase - the candidates for the designer position will have to produce and defend a redesigned page from the company&#39;s site. I don&#39;t anticipate too many problems there, at least not until I&#39;m back in front of the team defending my work. smile
