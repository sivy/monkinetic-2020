Well, we got another cat this weekend! &quot;Jake&quot; was adopted from animal control, was already fixed and so could come home with us on Saturday.

Jake&#39;s 1 year old, so is still basically a kitten, and he still has his claws - and he&#39;s fast! I think we&#39;ve been lulled into vulnerability by having older cats - Jake is a handfull! smile

Still, it&#39;s great having two cats again and Jake is a real sweetie. Here&#39;s hoping Lucy (current home owner, er, cat) will take to him!
