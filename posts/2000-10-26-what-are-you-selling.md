I don&#39;t necessarily agree with this. I know that UserLand had trouble selling <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> as a platform, and subsequently moved into the web content management space with <a href="http://manila.userland.com">Manila</a>. But I also know that there were a number of <i>very</i> successful products built on top of Frontier, including expensive ones, even when Frontier itself was free.

I think the success of a platform is closely tied to it&#39;s applications, but I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s up to the platform vendor to tell it&#39;s users what they should be using the platform for. I think they <i>should</i> be communicating their vision as a vendor, and push the solutions that  their users are creating. The companies building Frontier-based solutions didn&#39;t always get the most press from UserLand.

On the flip side, I know that Dave fought a long battle to get recognition from <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> for Frontier&#39;s power and elegance, and he speaks from that history, too.

It&#39;s not all cut and dried.
