Title: Making Fire
layout: post

An excerpt from an email at work:<p>

<blockquote>&quot;I can dig one up from my Boy Scout days (yeah, laugh, but I know how to make fire out of wet grass and a chipmunk) if you can wait til Monday.&quot;</blockquote>

I about died laughing. As a former Boy Scout, I remember days like that.</p>
