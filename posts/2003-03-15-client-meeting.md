Title: Client Meeting
layout: post

I had a meeting last night with a potential client, the owner of the local TruGreen ChemLawn. He&#39;s out spraying most of the day, so I said &quot;hey, come on over for dinner, I&#39;ll feed you and we can talk about your site&quot;.

A TiBook and a grill - now <i>that&#39;s</i> the way to host a client!

Oh, and I got the job. -) Of course, I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t have anything to do with the Teriyaki chicken and cheesecake...
