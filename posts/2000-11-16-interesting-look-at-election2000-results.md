Title: Interesting Look at Election2000 results
layout: post

USAToday has an interesting <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/cbc/map.htm" title="Election results by county">map</a> showing the elction results not by state but by county. Bush won a vast majority of the counties in the US.

But look where Gore won - the major population centers, where Democrats traditionally have a powerful base. (They are, if nothing else, efficient. ;-) Concentrate efforts where they reach the most people.)
