Title: Making Connections
layout: post

I posted recently about my new job at <a href="http://www.re-mac.com">Re-Mac Computers</a>. It&#39;s been a good few weeks! I&#39;ve enjoyed working with customers to help them find the Mac that works for them, and I&#39;ve had the chance to go out and help folks at their homes and businesses to get their Macs up and working as they should. Fun stuff!

Well, having started at Re-Mac I had no real intention of looking for anything more. I spent 18 mos. out of work, and was just happy to be working. I like the work, and was happy to have a fairly known schedule.

So... what&#39;s happened?

On Monday last week Jodi stumbled across a job posting for a local company on <a href="http://www.mactalent.com/">MacTalent</a>. It was a tech support position, and looked worth checking out. I called them up, then sent in a resume.

Well, a whirlwind week later, I had a new job! I&#39;ll be joining the team at <a href="http://www.contentcommunications.com">Content Connections</a> on the 29th, doing tech support for their Mac OS X network, second-tier phone support for their users, and also helping with development of the company&#39;s web-based tools.

There&#39;s a lot to share about this company, so I&#39;m going to break it into chapters... but this is definitely a new stage in our lives and I&#39;m really excited to start!!
