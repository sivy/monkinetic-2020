Title: NBC NBC Fires Fires Arnett Arnett
layout: post

I think someone was in way too much of a rush to get <a href="http://www.goupstate.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20030331&amp;Category=APE&amp;ArtNo=303310660&amp;Ref=AR">this story</a> online. The entire text of the story (it&#39;s not long) is included twice!

Oh, and the hoopla is all about how NBC fired Peter Arnett after he gave an interview to Iraqi television stating &quot;the US war effort has failed&quot;. Um, what?!? I guess Peter got tired of reporting news and decided to make some. Sheeesh.
