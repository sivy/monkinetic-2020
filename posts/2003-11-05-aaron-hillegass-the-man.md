layout: post

Recently Aaron Hillegass posted a <a href="http://cocoa.mamasam.com/COCOADEV/2003/10/2/75193.php">pointed diatribe</a> to the Cocoa-Dev list about Apple&#39;s new NSController layer in Mac OS 10.3. Today, he posted an <a href="http://cocoa.mamasam.com/COCOADEV/2003/11/1/76257.php">explanation and partial retraction</a>, showing an astounding amount of mental clarity and humility in the process. Way to go, Aaron!!
