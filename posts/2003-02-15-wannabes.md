Seth rants on the <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/2874">&quot;My blog don&#39;t get &#39;nuf hits!&quot;</a> crowd. My favorite quote:

<blockquote>&quot;Nobody&#39;s going to visit your site just to see what a great Xerox-wannabe you&#39;ve become.&quot;</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.truerwords.net/2875">My advice</a>, which I often forget:

<blockquote>&quot;Figure out why you like blogging and then do it, and nevermind anyone else.&quot;</blockquote>
