Since about July, I too have been living in Project Builder. In fact, as a WebObjects developer I lived there for the 8 months before that, too. But since I started hacking Sid again (and the mystery app) I've been hacking Cocoa instead of WebObjects.

God, I love it. &lt;plug&gt;If you want to hire me to hack Mac OS X apps, that would be fine with me. :-)&lt;/plug&gt;
