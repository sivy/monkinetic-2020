Title: weblogs.com decentralization
layout: post

<a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a> is &quot;having a spaz attack&quot; (as <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00000272.html">anita says</a>), and we in the blogging community are feeling the pain of centralization. Heck, I&#39;m wandering the &#39;net aimlessly without my <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker">Blogtracker</a> panel (fed by weblogs.com).

Therefore, it would make sense for some of us to create a decentralized notification network along the same lines. It could use XML-RPC or some other protocol, but it would definitely need to implement some sort of peer discovery (so that a new hub can find a few others to notify/get updates from).

Then each tracking service can either be a hub, or point to one of the peers that is. Anyone wanna get to work on this?
