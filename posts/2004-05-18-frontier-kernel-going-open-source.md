&gt;At some point in the next few months, there will be an open source release of the Frontier kernel. Not sure what license it&#39;ll use. There won&#39;t be any grand expectations of what kind of community will develop. Even if no bugs get fixed, if no features get added, if no new OSes are supported, it will be worth it, because its future will be assured. That&#39;s the point Ted makes, and that&#39;s my reasoning behind this.

Wow. I&#39;ve goot a few thoughts on this, but they can wait until later. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/3908">Seth</a> has some good stuff to say as a developer whose product depends on Frontier, as does <a href="http://duncan.smeed.org/4329">Duncan Smeed</a>, a long-time user as well.
