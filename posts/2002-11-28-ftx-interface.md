FTX is a web application that interfaces with Compass&#39; <a href="http://www.intellisafevault.com/">Intellisafe </a> product.

I worked with the team and with Compass analysts and industry experts to define the workflow process involved, then designed the first several iterations of the web interface, including all branding and functional screens.
