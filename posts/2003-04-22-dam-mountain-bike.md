Title: Dam Mountain Bike...
layout: post

This weekend <a href="http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog">Bill</a> and I went mountain biking over to the Cave Creek Dam (<a href="http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~jacksond/photos/9.8.gif">1922</a>, <a href="http://phoenix.gov/SCANPIC/cavedam.jpg">present day</a>). It was an awesome ride with diverse terrain, including cross country, hard packed trails, gorges, and the large wash in front of the dam.

Bill got some good pics, as well as video of me on a particularly fun downhill, which I&#39;ll post once he sends it to me.

Of course, I also ended up with a flat tire (slow leak, I made it home fine, and it wasn&#39;t until this afternoon that I found the tire completely flat). Rrgh. Should look into some of those solid tubes Bill had.

My wife, Jodi, should stop reading now...

I forgot to mention, this downhill was right by the dam itself, down the side of the wash, and even with the brakes on half the time I was going so fast all I could think of was &quot;don&#39;t biff this, don&#39;t biff this, don&#39;t biff this!&quot; I would have been a very messed up boy had I lost it at that speed...
