Title: Interoffice, no-ad IM?
layout: post

I have a client who has recently started IM&#39;ing, and is hooked. He wants to findd an IM app that he can use in his office for interoffice communications, but he doesn&#39;t like the ads that AIM includes.

I&#39;d suggest <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> to a larger company with an IT dep&#39;t to set it up, but this isn&#39;t that company. He&#39;s willing to pay a reasonable price for it, and it needs to run on Windows.

AIM compatibility would be a plus, if not a requirement. It doesn&#39;t have to be purely internal (meaning it can run on the AIM network if necessary), and ease of setup and use is key.

Suggestions?
