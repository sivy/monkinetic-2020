Man, this was annoying. Indeed, each <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> update seems to remove features. This is not a good sign, and Skype needs to start communicating with its users and explaining itself. Oh, and <a href="http://forum.skype.com/viewtopic.php?t=18951&sid=673b9a387d11adbba73aa77df2352a91">how's this for a change log entry</a>?

>* change: improved forced upgrade procedure

I'd ask, *improved for whom*?
