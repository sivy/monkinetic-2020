Title: A New Day
layout: post

Day two on the new Redmonk Conversant-powered weblog. So far my day sucks, starting at 2 am this morning when I awoke with a throbbing pain in a tooth. It kept me up til almost 5 am. So now I have an appointment for a root canal this afternoon. Ugh.

So how&#39;s your day going?
