Something we&#39;re learning about this year in Arizona: Winter lawns. Apparently the only thing that can survive the Arizona summer is a particularly hearty strain of Bermuda grass, which goes dormant and brown once the weather cools off. So the practice here is, right about now, to plant a winter lawn of rye grass that stays nice and soft and green until about April, when the weather heats up fries it all. I&#39;m researching winter lawns now; I mowed the lawn as short as possible the other day, and I&#39;m about to go de-thatch and put down gypsum to treat the soil. Then we plant.
