><a href="http://markbernstein.org/Oct0201.html#note_22825">Mark Bernstein</a>: "Tinderbox's default behavior is pretty good, but NetNewsWire has just added some new XML drag flavors that let Tinderbox understand whether youre dragging a news feed (which youd probably want to have updated automatically) or a news story (where you probably want to keep the summary in Tinderbox, and to provide easy access to the full story)."

>I'm so pleased! Thanks go to Mark and the <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox folks</a>. (<a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=2198">link</a>)

Wow, I may have been the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/spareparts/2002/09/30#item1479">first to support it</a>, but Mark and crew win the Oscar for "Coolest use of RSS in a Drag Operation".
