For no apparent reason but in approximate chronological order (yes, there are duplicates due to using multiple languages at several jobs):

* Perl
* Frontier's Usertalk
* VBScript
* JScript
* Javascript
* Java
* TCL
* Filemaker (internal scripting language)
* PHP
* Python
* Javascript
* Java
* Ruby
* Perl

That Is All.
