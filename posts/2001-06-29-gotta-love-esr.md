Good Ole <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-06-28-008-20-PS">Eric S. Raymond</a>: &quot;As for looking at .NET? Sure, we should be looking at it -- the same way the Samba guys look at SMB file shares. C# is a weak language design, a sort of pale imitation Java. But that just makes it easier to co-opt.&quot; Hmmmm. Related perhaps to <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/2001-04/GCC_net_01.html">this article</a>... Dot-GNet?
