Title: On The Road Again
layout: post

Well, Jodi [broke the news](http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2007/03/19/an-overdue-announcement). Not that it was a secret. In fact you, dear Reader, *may* be the last person to know that Jodi and I have begun another adoption. :-) This time around we&#39;re working with a large well-connected agency, [WACAP](http://wacap.org/), and we&#39;re planning on going to Russia.

As 99% of you know, Adelina is deaf. Learning what that means for her and for us has been a challenging road for Jodi and I, and it&#39;s been an exciting road. We&#39;ve learned more about ourselves in the last months and year than we probably did in the previous 5 years. And we have this bright, blond explosion in our home, teaching us about life in new ways every day! So it&#39;s with joy, excitement, anticipation, and not a small amount of terror, that we&#39;re setting out to adopt another deaf child.

Yep - we&#39;re going looking this time. It&#39;s not something we&#39;ve taken to lightly. For us as hearing parents, Adelina has not required massive changes in our lifestyle - she is very verbal, and communicated quite clearly to us that she wanted to hear and speak. We do sign with Adelina, though in general sign is used in a supporting role. In seeking out another deaf child, we have no idea if s/he will be as auditory/verbal as Adelina, or more visual/sign-oriented. We&#39;re completely open to either, which is why (as Jodi also mentions) we&#39;re enrolled in a local community college <abbr title="American Sign Language">ASL</abbr> class and are working hard on wrapping some proper grammar around our moderate vocabulary. I also finally pulled the tv out from the wall and braved the morass of a/v and network cables behind it to re-connect our [VP](http://sorenson.com/products/ &quot;Video Phone&quot;), so we&#39;re once again able to connect with our deaf friends (sorry for the down-time guys, blame it on the network idiot who forgot how to connect the thing...). (*waves to Sasha*)

Well, more later. Back to work!
