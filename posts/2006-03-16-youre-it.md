Title: You're It!
layout: post

I&#39;ve been futzing with tags lately on this site. I&#39;ve wanted to add tagging to my posts for some time (managing categories was too hard), and got around to installing the [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/) plugin for Wordpress. It&#39;s impressive in it&#39;s scope of features and complete ease of use. I&#39;ve spent some time tagging the last year&#39;s worth of content (not as much as you might think) and it&#39;s a quick and easy process.

So, the [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com) tags are listed below each post, or - if you click the permalink - you can see links to the local tags.

You can check out my &quot;[tag cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud)&quot; [here](/archives-by-tag) to see that &quot;family&quot; is so far my heaviest topic by a small margin, with things like &quot;apple&quot; and &quot;webdesign&quot; in the top 5 or 10.
