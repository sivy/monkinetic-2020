Title: "Wanted: One default .tcshrc file from an OS X installation"
layout: post

Yeah, yeah, the <i>real</i> unix admins make backups of any file they&#39;re going to delete. And if they&#39;re just testing, they don&#39;t actually delete the file, they just move it or rename it. <i>I</i>, on the other hand, am still waking up and got a tad enthusiastic.

Anyone have a spare default .tcshrc file?
