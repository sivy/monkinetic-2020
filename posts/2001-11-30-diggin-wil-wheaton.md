Title: Diggin' Wil Wheaton
layout: post

Ok, so, like everyone else I *hated* Wes Crusher on ST:TNG (those who care will know what that means). But  I must say that Wil Wheaton, Wes Crusher look-alike and all-around geeky dude, is a riot. And he has his own oft-updated blog and discussion group. Wil&#39;s been on my &quot;Reads&quot; list for months now - check him out.<p>
