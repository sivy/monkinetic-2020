Title: New Verizon TV Commercial Slags AT&T's Network
layout: post

>This is a brilliant ad campaign from Verizon. The "there's a map for that" slogan is cute, but the "Before you pick a phone, pick a network" slogan sounds like common sense and works directly to Verizon's advantage. They're selling their strength (the network) instead of spinning their weakness (their lineup of phones). The ad works because it's true.
