Title: Librarians Rule
layout: post

<a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/">The Shifted Librarian</a> joined my must read list out sheer gratitude for <a href="http://www.librarianavengers.com/nflibrary.html">this link</a>:<p>

<blockquote>&quot;People become librarians because they know too much. Their knowledge extends beyond mere categories. They cannot be confined to disciplines. Librarians are all-knowing and all-seeing. They bring order to chaos. They bring wisdom and culture to the masses. They preserve every aspect of human knowledge. Librarians rule. And they will kick the crap out of anyone who says otherwise.&quot;</blockquote>

I had the dubious pleasure of working with a guy with an I.S. (Information Sciences) degree and most of an M.L.S. (Master of Library Science). When it came to just knowing <i>stuff</i> (and I consider myself a rather proficient knower of <i>stuff</i>) this guy was off the charts. Mark could tell you something about anything, and he was spot-on with &#39;net searches. Mark, if you&#39;re out there, I&#39;m still bowing!</p>
