Title: Web Services For Web Developers

Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/01/31#l6a79e5ea81d34b2681825105f2215b89">writes</a>: &quot;We&#39;re going to make Web services work for Web developers. That means getting rid of arcane stuff that makes sense only to C programmers. &quot;<p>
Well, I understand where Dave is coming from, but I have to argue that without C and its practitioners of arcana, the &quot;web&quot; in &quot;web services&quot; would not exist. The xml parser in Frontier&#39;s <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/xml/rpc">web services support</a> would be 100 times slower. <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> - don&#39;t tell me that&#39;s not a web service! ;-) - would not exist.<p>
Dave, you&#39;re not being fair to people who use those languages. I totally appreciate what you&#39;re doing in the scripting world. Seeing web services brought to the masses through your involvement in XML-RPC is a huge deal. We all talk about web services being about <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/03/19/">inclusive</a>: don&#39;t lock out or insult those developers who choose to use .NET or whatever.<p>
I mean, <i>who cares</i> that there are six extra lines in that script? How many lines is a common web service? 5? 100? 1000? If a developer wants to write those 6 lines (which are probably generated for him) why can&#39;t he? Is it just because it offends your aesthetic?</p></p></p>
