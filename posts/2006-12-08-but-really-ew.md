Title: But really. Ew.
layout: post

Supreme Court Justices Scalia and Breyer participated in a debate sponsored by the American Constitution Society and the Federalist Society. On Slate.com, Dahlia Lithwick [descibes their diverging styles](http://www.slate.com/id/2154993/):

>And if this debate mirrors a marketplace of ideas, Breyer will make the sale through the earnest personal connection of a Wal-Mart greeter, while Scalia opts for the aloof certainty of the Tiffany's salesman: "Sure, you can buy some other, cheaper constitutional theory, but really. Ew."

The closer is great as well:

>Stephen Breyer's jurisprudential Grover &emdash; sweet and optimistic and eager-to-please &emdash;is working the room, confident he'll sell us on his constitutional theory, one lawyer at a time. And Antonin Scalia's constitutional Oscar the Grouch &emdash; frustrated and misunderstood, yet somehow more lovable for it &emdash; doesn't even try to close the deal. He doesn't need us to vindicate him. He's confident history will do that.
