&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll also be working on making pages load faster, and Mac OS X rendering in general. This most likely includes making the gecko rendering engine use the Quartz API intead of Quickdraw. This will bring a lot of benefits, including making use of your graphics card to do a lot of the work that your CPU is doing right now because we use Quickdraw.&quot;

This is great news! Both Camino and Firefox are great browsers, and they&#39;re going to be getting better. Josh will also be helping to make Firefox look even more like a &quot;Mac&quot; app, with native widgets, etc.
