layout: post


I posted a quick update on the [Wallrazer blog](http://www.wallrazer.com/2011/02/14/related-items.html) about some recent work: the [Related Items plugin for MT](https://github.com/sivy/mt-plugin-related-items), released under the perl license [thanks to Endevver](http://endevver.com) (I'll update this to point to Endevver's repo once it's been updated with the latest changes).
