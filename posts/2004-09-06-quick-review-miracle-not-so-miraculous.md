Title: "Quick Review: &quot;Miracle&quot; not so miraculous"
layout: post

|Jodi|&#39;s parents are in town for the holiday weekend, and last night we watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0349825/">Miracle</a>, the story of the 1980 US Olympic hockey team and their quest to beat the indomitable Soviets in the Lake Placid games. All in all, a good story, a classic underdog story.

But despite all the raves the movie got from friends and family, I wasn&#39;t that impressed. I liked the hockey (a sport that is growing on me despite living in a desert) but the characterizations were weak, all in all. <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000621/">Kurt Russell</a> did a pretty good job as coach Herb Brooks, but all the other characters and relationships in the movie were only sketched out at best. I also thought that the numerous references to current events of the time felt tacked on, designed to win &quot;context points&quot;. I suppose they were designed to help explain the mood of the nation at the time, but they were not well connected to the coach and his 20 players - which should have been the focus of the film.

Gratuitous self-analysis: what does it say about me, or about our movie culture, that at the end I wanted more to see the Russians suffer in anguish over their defeat than the US team rejoicing? Am I such a vengeful person? Or am I still feeling the effects of my own upbringing in the tail end of the cold war? The Lake Placid games are the first Olympics I have a memory of (though they&#39;re sketchy - I was 9 at the time) and I have a vague memory of the hoopla surrounding the hockey events, but not much else.

Anyway, not a *bad* film, but at 136 minutes I expected a bit more for my time.
