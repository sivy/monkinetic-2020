Donald J. Trump is having a rotten impact on relationships in my life.

That's a sentence (among *many*) I never thought I'd be saying[^1].

A while back my wife and I had taken to occasionally asking each other questions from [the Ungame](https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Ungame-All-Ages-Version/dp/B000BXJZ16) at night before bed. It was a nice slow-down from the day, often interesting and often funny. We're doing it almost very night now because it gives us something to talk about that *isn't Trump or politics*, topics which get us both steaming and frustrated.

*My in-laws are in town* and I know they voted for Trump. I love them dearly and know why they voted the way they did. It doesn't take away the sting of knowing I can't really talk about or process the election with them without causing more harm than good. I may yet get to where I can be civil about it, but that's not yet.

I'm mostly off Facebook these days. Seeing family, church friends, and people in my wider network sharing pro-Trump posts  - *I've even seen Breitbart links* - just discourages me to no end. It literally saps my will to even engage on the platform. I haven't deleted FB yet from my phone but I've thought about it.

I'm conflicted. My inner demons are hassling me about being a rich white whiner, but I'm also just depressed and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get through this.

[^1]: I would have assumed that if I were *ever* discussing any impact Trump had on my life, it would be a negative impact, but not for the reasons we're now discussing.
