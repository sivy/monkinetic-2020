<a href="http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> is a Mac OS (Classic only for now) application that lets you manage information in a multiview graphical way; including an outline view and a very cool-looking map view. Tinderbox is also a sort of content-management system and can be used to generate HTML, XML, and syndication files (RSS feeds), as well as consume RSS feeds. As soon as the Mac OS X version comes out I&#39;m gonna seriously check this out.
