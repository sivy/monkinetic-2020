Title: The anti-Brent
layout: post

Brent Simmons, of Userland Software, has found the anti-Brent weblog - as in the weblogs he considers most <i>opposite</i> to his own. He disagrees with <i>everything</i> on it. I wonder which one it is?

Well, it&#39;s not this one, I&#39;m sure. But after reading <a href="http://www.inessential.com">Brent&#39;s site</a> for a while, I would say that I&#39;m probably close to an anti-Brent politically. Brent is an unabashed, proud, Democrat. I, on the other hand, have voted Republican in every election I&#39;ve had the privilege to vote in, and generally find <a href="http://www.gwbushsucks.com/">George-Bush-is-a-moron</a> jokes in bad taste.

It&#39;s not really that I consider myself a dyed-in-the-wool Republican. It&#39;s just that I disagree, in principle, with just about everything that liberals believe, especially when it comes to the solutions they propose to this country&#39;s problems.

At the core is my belief that the true strength of this nation lies in the freedom of the individual - all individuals, not just rich ones as most Democrats would have you believe - and *not* in the so-called benevolence of our Government.

I believe that indivuals create the wealth we enjoy, and that it is not the government&#39;s place to re-distribute it to make things &quot;fair&quot;. Life isn&#39;t fair. That means redistribution via taxes, income or otherwise, OR &quot;so-called&quot; tax-cuts that actually give money to those who pay little to no taxes, while raising the burden on those who create the wealth in this nation.

I do believe in supply-side economics.

I do not believe that all money is the Government&#39;s, and we should be grateful that they let us keep any of it at all. That kind of thinking gave us the Soviet Union.

Well. That&#39;s the fiscal part of my rant, perhaps some other time I&#39;ll go off on the media.
