Title: Refocusing
layout: post

It seems every few weeks these days, I&#39;m asking myself why I&#39;m blogging. I haven&#39;t yet come up with a &quot;resonable&quot; answer, but I also know that I&#39;m still *really* enjoy it, even if my posts have become sporadic at best.

To throw a monkey wrench into the habit, I set up a linklog (links, sans commentary) over at [DELICIOUSLYMETA](http://deliciouslymeta.com &quot;something about being about something&quot;), a domain so enticing I spent Father&#39;s day cash on it, I simply had to have it. I&#39;ll be moving some of my more random posting over there.

That done, I plan to refocus on actually *writing* on this site. Perhaps even more infrequently, but hopefully wit more thought, a little more wit, and perhaps somewhat less nerdy humor.

Ok, that last one&#39;s a joke. I gotta be me.
