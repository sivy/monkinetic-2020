[Chris Alden](http://chris.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/your-blog-is-your-mothership.html) quotes [Web Worker Daily](http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/08/22/your-blog-is-your-mothership/):

&gt;There are tons of ways to build a web presence, including a variety of social media and networking sites, but nothing is as important as your blog.

Boy, could this blog use a dose of that attitude. :-)
