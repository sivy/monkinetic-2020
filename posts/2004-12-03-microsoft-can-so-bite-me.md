Title: Microsoft can so bite me
layout: post

You can&#39;t use DHTML to <a href="http://www.insidedhtml.com/forums/getMessage.asp?m_id=54280">change the contents of &lt;table&gt; or &lt;tr&gt; elements in IE6</a>.

&gt;MSDN says this: &quot;However, because of the specific structure required by tables, the innerText and innerHTML properties of the table and tr objects are read-only.&quot;

Of course, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> and Mozilla/<a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> engineers seem to have been able to make the &quot;structure required by tables&quot; work for them, as my javascript works just fine there.
