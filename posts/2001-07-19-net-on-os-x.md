layout: post

Halcyon Software <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/cgi-bin/f_headline.cgi?bw.071801/211990338">is bringing .NET</a> to Mac OS X. They are actually converting Microsoft&#39;s Intermediate Language (like Java&#39;s bytecodes) to Java .class files or source code, and will be providing the complete ASP.NET (including ADO.NET and WebForms) later this year.<br />
&quot; Halcyon is currently working with selected customers on deploying ASP.NET projects to the OS X environment. It expects to move into a formal Beta in October 2001.&quot; Cooool.
