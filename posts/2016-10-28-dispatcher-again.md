I've been raving a bit on Twitter and here on the blog about [John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com)'s new  audio novella, [The Dispatcher](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/FREE-The-Dispatcher-Audiobook/B01KKPH1VA). It's a very engaging listen - and part of that is because it was envisioned and written as an audio book first and only.

That being said, [this interview on Audiblerange](http://audiblerange.com/categories/inside-audible/dispatches-from-zachary-quinto/) with the narrator - Zachary Quinto (of audio book [The Dispatcher](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/FREE-The-Dispatcher-Audiobook/B01KKPH1VA) fame[^1]) - gets into some of the recording process as well as why The Dispatcher is so good, and you should read it.
