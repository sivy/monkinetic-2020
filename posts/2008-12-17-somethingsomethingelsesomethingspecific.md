Every once in a while someone links to some bit of my "stuff" that I had completely forgotten about, and it's kinda fun.

On Monday, Aaron at Flickr posted to their [Code.Flickr blog](http://code.flickr.com/blog) about machine tags, and linked to [a chat](http://echoloquation.com/post/6939803/something-somethingelse-somethingspecific) between [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/journal) and I that had made it onto my tumblr blog, [echoloquation](http://echoloquation.com/).

Firstly, of course, you developer types should [read the post](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2008/12/15/machine-tag-hierarchies/). It's very informative, and even more, useful as Flickr is introducing some cool work around machine tags.

Secondly, it reminded me that I still had that [echoloquation lifestream blog](echoloquation.com), and how cool I still think the idea is. I may rebuild it soon as an MT [Action Streams](plugins.movabletype.org/action-streams/) site, which I can host on my own server. Yay, another project! I mean, wait...
