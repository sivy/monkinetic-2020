I saw O&#39;Reilly&#39;s articles on <a href="http://www.fscript.org">F-Script</a> a while back (<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2001/11/30/scripting_fscript.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/21/browsing_cocoa.html">2</a>), but had not had time to download and poke around with it. It&#39;s pretty sweet, andd the object browser is an incredible means of learning the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/index.html">Cocoa APIs</a>. Wow. Have to work with it more now.
