Title: Need help finding digital camera
layout: post

Jodi and I have decided to get a digital camera. Specifically, we&#39;ve decided on the <a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/PSS30/PSS30-e.html">Canon Powershot S30</a>. We had settled on the <a href="http://www.nikon-image.com/eng/PDF/index775.htm">Nikon Coolpix 775</a>, but switched to the Canon for the following reasons:
<li>3.2 Megapixel camera: the Coolpix was only 2.14</li>
<li>More ergonomic shape and weight - the 775 was just a bit TOO compact and boxy.</li>
<li>The Powershot has a microphone for capturing video AND sound; it can also be used to annotate stills I believe.</li>
<li>The menuing system on the Powershot is a marvel of tiny Information Architecture. The Nikon&#39;s menu was nearly incomprehensible.</li>

So, now we need to find a good deal on it. Actually, I just found out that I&#39;m getting a nice check from a client, so I may skip good deal and go for convenience. ;-) Still, I&#39;d like to hear from someone with experience finding good deals with reputable retailers online.
