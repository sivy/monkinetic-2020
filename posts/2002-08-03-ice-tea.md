I heard a great story on NPR today: <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/aug/icedtea/index.html">Making the Perfect Iced Tea</a>. Although I grew up in Virginia, my parents were both from elsewhere - so I didn&#39;t grow up with a traditional Southern Ice Tea tradition. However, my mother did turn me onto one great thing: &quot;sun tea&quot;.

Fill a large clear glass pitcher or jar with water, add four or five tea bags, and set out in the sun for a few hours. The heating action of the sun warms the water slowly, and convection mixes the tea with the water. It produces a remarkably smooth tea.

Being so inspired, I set out a pitcher this afternoon (4 bags random Orange Pekoe, one bag Colorado Berry tea). We do, after all, live in Sun Valley. And it&#39;s good tea. Once I&#39;ve perfected my recipe, I&#39;m going to christen it &quot;Valley of the Sun Tea&quot;. -)
