Title: With Apologies to the Other Steve Ivy
layout: post

Ok, so I&#39;ve been doing some thinking about this whole <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2004/07/15/the-other-steve-ivy">other Steve Ivy thing</a>. While <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Steve+Ivy&amp;sourceid=firefox&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">0wnz0ring the top spot on Google</a> may be fun for bloggers who enjoy messing with PageRank, it&#39;s not really fair for someone like <a href="http://apps.heritagecoin.com/wordfromsteve.php">Steve Ivy</a>, lead coin expert at <a href="http://www.heritagegalleries.com/common/about.php?target=ivy">Heritage Gelleries</a>.

Steve has a legitimate expertise and a well known business. While I&#39;m a web weenie with w soapbox. Who are users more likely to be looking for? I don&#39;t know. Anyway, I&#39;m not going to be sponsoring any more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlebomb">google bombs</a> just to artificially hype myself. I&#39;ll let the users work out who they want.

Thanks to the couple <a href="http://greg.turtleprod.com/2038">friends</a> and <a href="http://badgertronics.com/blog/">bloggers</a> who heeded my call for links, for better or worse. :-)
