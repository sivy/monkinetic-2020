I&#39;ve found myself with a growing interest lately in a category of applications loosely known as &quot;Social Software&quot;. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/">Emerging Tech</a> conference has a <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/22/track_ssoftware.html">track</a> on it, and I&#39;m still trying to cobble together a definition thereof for my own use. (For further reading, Clay Shirky has a bunch of <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">writings</a> on related topics too).

So far, in my mind, social software is software the reaches out of the desktop or internet and changes the way I move though the world as a person. That&#39;s weak, and entirely too vague, I know. It may even be <i>completely wrong</i>. The O&#39;Reilly track:

<blockquote>&quot;Explores work designed to support two-way communications in groups.&quot;</blockquote>

That&#39;s probably a workable definition on one plane; I think my concept of social software is a bit more hands-on: software that messes with the social dynamic. Ok, perhaps too pretentious. I don&#39;t know. Blurring the lines is this thing where I tend to lump in wireless technologies like WiFi and the <a href="http://www.hiptop.com">Danger Hiptop</a> - hardware+software platforms that bring the connective stickiness of the internet into our lives and in our hands - <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com">SmartMobs</a>.

So what do you think? What makes software &quot;social&quot;? What do you think of that place where the internet and other data services intersect with our &quot;real lives&quot;? I&#39;d like your thoughts - you can <a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;&lt;!--#msgnum--&gt;/reply">reply</a> to this post and follow the thread <a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;discussion/thread.html$msgnum=&lt;!--#msgnum--&gt;">here</a>.
