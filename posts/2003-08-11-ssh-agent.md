I&#39;ve been trying to get ssh-agent running on my os x box so that I can work on a remote linux box without having to type my password everytime, and I&#39;m having a crap time getting it to work, and I have no idea why.

If you&#39;re an ssh guru, <i>please</i> look over <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/ssh-agent-debug.txt">this transcript</a> and tell me if you see what the trouble might be?
