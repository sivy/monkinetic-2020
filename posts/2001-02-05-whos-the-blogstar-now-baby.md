Title: Who's the blogstar now, baby?
layout: post

Maybe it&#39;s all the recent news of <a href="http://www.pyra.com">Pyra</a>&#39;s recently, but last night I dreamed I met <a href="http://www.powazek.com/">Derek Powazek</a>, who was doing massages for cash. Strange.

I really don&#39;t mean to be cruel about the title - but like &quot;Jim&quot;, I often felt like the Blogger folks were <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/2001/02/01#item1681">like the popular high school kids</a>...

I am sad though that things have gone the way they have for <a href="http://www.evhead.com">Evan</a> et al. Good luck guys.
