>However, the startup chime is ingrained into the experience of having a Mac, I’m sad to see it go. A Mac without the chime feels broken, even if I know it isn’t. I don’t power down my machines often, but I liked hearing the chime when I power them back up.

I'll feel the startup chime's absence more than any missing port or spec (cries). The Mac is changing - as it must. The startup chime connected today's Macs to the whole history, the red thread of user-friendliness that marked the Mac as something that "Just Worked".

Sorry, I'm just a bit choked up.
