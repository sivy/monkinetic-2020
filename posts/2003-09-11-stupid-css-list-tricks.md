Title: Stupid CSS List Tricks
layout: post

Max Design has a <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/listamatic/index.htm">really cool page</a> detailing all sorts of interesting CSS techniques for styling HTML lists.

Ironically, the <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/">Max Design home page</a> (which uses a bunch of lists for navigation) does not use styled HTML lists, but IMG tags and BR tags instead. Interesting.
