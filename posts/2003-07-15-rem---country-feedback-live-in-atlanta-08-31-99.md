Country Feedback is one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, from the album Out Of Time.

Of the 5 versions I have, the best one I think is a live recording from Atlanta, August 31, 1999. Michael Stipe&#39;s vocals are ragged and haunting, the live, loose, setting lends an even more desperate tone to an already impassioned lyric. 

Peter Buck&#39;s guitar work goes on and on, with a lot more distortion, reverb, and yes, feedback than the (now seemingly) anemic album version. He plays all around the melody, lurching through his signature arpeggios, and even getting a decent solo feel to it, which was never his strong point.

One of the things I love about this song is it&#39;s determinedly languid pace. It flows and flows, Stipe&#39;s extra lyrics and vocalizations toward the end slide along on top of the music, drawing you in. 

<i>In my mind&#39;s eye I see the wooden shack above the bank slide by as the river carries me past - slow, green, and cyprus-choked...</i>
