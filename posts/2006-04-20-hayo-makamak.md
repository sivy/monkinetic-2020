Title: hayo makamak
layout: post

After A's IEP meeting today, we had the opportunity to use one of my personal favorite terms, *high-up mucky-muck*. Jodi always gives me a weird look when I use it, so I decided to finally look the durn thing up. After a few false starts, I found the origin on answers.com - It's actually "[High Muck-a-muck](http://www.answers.com/topic/high-muckamuck)":

>[From Chinook Jargon hayo makamak, plenty to eat.]

>it seems that English borrowed the term from Chinook Jargon, a pidgin language combining words from English, French, Nootka, Chinook, and the Salishan languages

>In 1856 we find the first recorded instance of the word meaning "pompous person, person of importance," in the Democratic State Journal published in Sacramento: "The professors &emdash; the high "Muck-a-Mucks" &emdash; tried fusion, and produced confusion."
