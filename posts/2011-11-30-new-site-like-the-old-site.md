After procrastinating for many months, I've finally moved [this site](http://monkinetic.com) off of Typepad and into [Octopress](http://octopress.com) the fancy-pants [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) variant. This is no means any kind of indictment of Typepad -- it's a great platform that has served me well for a few years. But it was time for a change: the hacker, poker, and pusher-of-buttons in me needed a new platform to hack, poke, and push on.

The site is now hosted on [Linode](http://linode.com), who are *awesome*, the blog is simple to update and snappy to serve. There are some differences, visual and otherwise. The design is more responsive now (through the small sizes are not perfect yet). I'm also not linking to the monthly archives any more in the sidebar, though you can access them through the Archives link in the main nav. I'm also including recent tweets and a list of some of my github repositories, since they came standard with Octopress and they're kinda neat, in a nerdy way.

This is also a bit of a life-hack: by switching platforms I'm hoping to get back to the heart of why I started blogging. It was simply about having a platform for sharing my life and interests, regardless of what everyone else was doing, and that's where I want to get back to.
