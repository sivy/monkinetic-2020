An old friend <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/187">popped in to ask</a>, on the subject of Teen Pop:

<i>yes I agree that teen pop must die, but what will follow?</i>

I don&#39;t know yet. But here&#39;s <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/188">why I hate teen pop</a>.

<i>I prefer the home-grown, young-punks-in-a-garage, toured-podunksville-for-four-years-before-being-discovered appproach. Bands that sing from experience, who write their own stuff, and live or die by it. <a href="http://www.u2.com">Bands</a> that can survive almost being named &quot;The Hype&quot; before realizing their insanity and taking the name of a spyplane instead. <a href="http://www.remhq.com">Bands</a> that can survive their lead singer being almost completely unintelligible for most of his career.

What&#39;s coming next? Dunno. <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/188/reply">What do you think</a>?</i>
