Title: "GoDaddy Software: Web UI Designer/Developer needed"
layout: post

A development team here at [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) (see standard disclaimer below) is looking for a web UI developer and I thought I&#39;d post it here as a way to help out. This is a standards-based (X)HTML/CSS/Javascript developer position,  working with java code on a open-source stack (linux/apache/tomcat/hibernate/struts...).

&gt;(Scottsdale, AZ) GoDaddy Software is searching for an exceptional web UI developer, with strong visual sense, to help completely revamp the user interfaces for a new generation of our PKI applications.

&gt;You will have built exceptional, cross-browser web sites, and be proficient with (X)HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and modern dynamic HTML techniques. You&#39;ll also appreciate the importance of usability and excellent visual design.

&gt;Experience with Java-based web front-end development is important - though expert status is not required - you&#39;re going to work faster and more efficiently if you can navigate an open source linux/Apache/MySQL/Tomcat/JSP stack with ease. A BS in Computer science or a related field wouldn&#39;t hurt.

&gt;GoDaddy Software is known for excellent customer service, aggressive development cycles, highly competitive salaries and fantastic benefits. As part of a team inside the industry leader in domain registrations and
hosting services, see your work improving the web experience for hundreds of thousands of users.

&gt;We offer competitive salary, 100% employer paid medical and dental (for employees), three weeks of vacation available in your first year, 401(k) and educational assistance.
