Title: Meg Had A Dream...
layout: post

Meg Hourihan had a wild <a href="http://www.megnut.com/life/002534.asp">sci-fi/weblog</a> dream. (Read it first then come back.)

The salient idea for me was that of multiple levels of a weblog building, with the higher layers reserved for more personal information. So I&#39;m thinking, I use a system that will let me put users in groups, perhaps based on how well I know them. Then I could configure my system to only allow users in certain groups to view certain weblog posts. Interesting idea, but ultimately doomed because it would be too easy for another blogger, in a priveleged group, to point to something on my weblog that they don&#39;t realize is in a higher access level than the public could see.

Anyway, some interesting thoughts.
