Robert X Cringely is a tech columnist for PBS. This week <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20020425.html">his son died of SIDS</a> (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), while lying in Robert&#39;s lap as he did his email. It&#39;s... horrible. My thoughts and prayers go out to Robert and his family.

Robert is starting a quest for a monitor that can help advance medical knowledge of SIDS, and hopefully one day lead to a device that can predict it. As he says:

<blockquote>The old, broken-down engineer in me says it is time to build something.</blockquote>
