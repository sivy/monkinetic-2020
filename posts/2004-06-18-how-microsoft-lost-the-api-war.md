Joel is a *really* good writer and his company makes a web-based bug tracking system called <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ">FogBugz</a>. He&#39;s been a <abbr title="(Microsoft&#39;s) Visual Basic">VB</abbr> developer for many years and has written some great articles on why Microsoft and its  technologies are so predominant - articles that make me, a Mac user, really think while cringing. :-)
