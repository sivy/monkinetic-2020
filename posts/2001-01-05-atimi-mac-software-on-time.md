Title: Atimi - Mac Software, on time
layout: post

Thanks to &quot;Jim&quot; for the pointer to <a href="http://www.atimi.com/index.html">Atimi</a>, and new Mac development shop. It looks like they offer outsourcing services for other dev shops, and porting services for existing Windows apps. Hope this helps bring more great software to the Mac!

It also looks like they may have some &quot;Mac OS X&quot; experience. Cool.
