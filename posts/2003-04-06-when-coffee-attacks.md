Title: When Coffee Attacks!!
layout: post

Ok, so I nuke a cup of lukewarm coffee to warm it up. I take it out, and dump in a teaspoon of sugar. Very normal.

Not very normal: the coffee absolutely <i>erupts</i> out of the mug, foaming all over my hand (ow!), the counter, and to the floor! I&#39;m like what the heck?!?

Any science buffs out there ever see this aggressive coffee behavior!?
