Heh. Meme-fun from [Wolf](http://rentzsch.com/notes/googleUnfortunatelyYourName)

>Passed along from a GoogleFriend, it's surprisingly wacky to Google your first name, prepending "unfortunately"

Here's "[Unfortunately Steve](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22unfortunately+Steve%22&hl=en&lr=&pwst=1&start=10&sa=N)":

* Unfortunately, Steve will be incarcerated the entire time - _you better believe I will be_
* Unfortunately, Steve doesn't provide examples of Apple's crappy products - _there are crappy Apple products?_
* Unfortunately, Steve, the barley straw trick requires bright sunlight to break the humics from the straw down into algicidal by-products - _dammit, why doesn't anyone tell me these things beforehand?_
* Unfortunately, Steve could not come due to a "last minute budget freeze" - _the wife has my credit cards_
* Unfortunately Steve didn't make it into professional football - _I was just too good for them_
* Unfortunately Steve died a second time after foiling the plot in question - _but the memorial service was really nice_
