title: 'Chris Krycho: Chrome is not the Standard'
---
[Chris Krycho](http://www.chriskrycho.com/) wrote a thoughtful post about the state of browser development and web standards, and as developers, the tendency sometimes to see Chrome as the standard for what features browsers  should be supporting. [Chrome is not the Standard](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html):

> Over the past few years, I've increasingly seen articles with headlines that run something like, "New Feature Coming To the Web"— followed by content which described how Chrome had implemented an experimental new feature. "You’ll be able to use this soon!" has been the promise.

> These are tradeoffs, plain and simple. Chrome ships new features fast, but they're not always stable and they often have performance costs. Safari ships new features on a much slower cadence, but they're usually solid and always perform incredibly well.

> That's what makes the web so great, even when it makes things move more slowly. Sometimes — often, even! — moving more slowly not in the experimental phase but in the finalizing phase makes for a much better outcome overall.

Fellow #webnerds, it's a good read.
