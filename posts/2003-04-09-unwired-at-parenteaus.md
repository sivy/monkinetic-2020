Chillin today at my buddy JP&#39;s house. He telecommutes on Tuesdays, so we&#39;re hangin&#39; out today, working on our respective stuff.

I helped JP set up his <a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.asp?prodID=151&amp;view=">Netgear wireless router/hub</a> last night, and he&#39;s stoked to be VPNed into work over his broadband connection, and wireless too! Coooooool.
