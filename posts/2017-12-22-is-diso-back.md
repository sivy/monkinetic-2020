title: Is DiSo Back?
---
Kevin Marks asks "[is DiSo back?](http://known.kevinmarks.com/2017/diso-is-back-im-wearing-my-social-graph-foo-camp)" I hadn't thought about it, but...

*Damn straight DiSo is back.*

Not necessarily the project, but the ideas? Absolutely. As we begin to see the Silos we created for [what they are](https://www.monkinetic.blog/the-revolution-will-be-federated.html), some are building the tools to re-colonize the Open Web. Are you publishing online? Do you own your own content? Are you sure? Or are you dependent on the Twitters and Facebooks of the world to carry (and monetize) your writing, your activities, your family photos?

I know I still am in many ways. It's just so *easy*. But easy leads to exploitation. So tie your shoes, button your coat, and *get to work*:
