Title: A Year Apart
layout: post

(Ok, so I can't get away from the [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com) / [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com) puns (cf [A Move Apart](http://www.monkinetic.com/2008/09/a-move-apart.html)). Sorry.)

So, a couple days ago I celebrated [my first year](http://twitter.com/monkinetic/status/4017603445) with Six Apart. Hard to believe it's already been 12 months since I [left my java front end development job with GoDaddy](http://www.monkinetic.com/2008/09/a-move-apart.html) and started [working for Six Apart full time from home](http://www.monkinetic.com/2008/09/six-apart-day-1.html).

I've worked remotely before, as a contractor for a company in California doing [OpenACS](http://openacs.org/) development, but working remotely as a full-time employee has been a whole new experience. It's not the same as working side by side on a daily basis, but it's [suprisingly effective](http://www.monkinetic.com/2008/09/an-update-on-the-virtual-office.html) nonetheless. It helps that I'm not the only remote employee - there are 3 or 4 others on our team that work from home at least part time, and a couple that are pretty much full-time like me.

I've had the privilege of working on some amazing projects this year, and working with some *great* designers and coders. Our [Services](http://sixapart.com/services) team builds awesome sites and applications using our products (mostly Movable Type), and I'm grateful that I've been able to be a humble part of this team.

I really want thank Six Apart and especially David Jacobs (VP of Services) for giving me the opportunity to "[do work that I love, while being around the people that I love here at home](http://twitter.com/monkinetic/status/4067766732)".
