Title: Weighing in on CSS
layout: post

I&#39;ve been watching the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/17#hurdlesCssMustOvercome" title="dave weighs in">latest</a> <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/00000151.html" title="mark weighs in">blogger</a> <a href="http://www.designweenie.com/blog/archive.php?1013622226" title="james weighs in">war</a>: css vs. tables - which is actually not new by any means, but this just happens to be when the blogging community got around to it.

Anyway, I&#39;ve been meaning to do more on that front for a long time, and reading all the opinions on it prompted me to give it a go. It was hard. But I&#39;ve got it going now and I underrtand it a lot better. Check out the test results at http://www.redmonk.net/blog.
