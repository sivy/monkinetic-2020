Title: "Why is Adobe Flash Installing Google Chrome?"

So, like a sheep, I install the latest Adobe Flash (bleagh) this morning so I can watch the Superb Owl Iron Man 3 commercial, since Adobe's being a snot and pigging backing on the Superb Owl's popularity to get more Flash installs out there, and I see this:

Since when does Flash install Chrome? */me Googles*

Apparently, since at least August of 2012 accordion to this Adobe Forum post:

>For regularly scheduled Flash Player releases, such as our 11.4 release, users are notified of new features included in the release and may opt to download the latest player via http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer.  This workflow allows users to optionally download software from select Adobe partners along with Flash Player.  Adobe offsets the ongoing development costs of Flash Player, which is made available for free, by offering users these options.

Hm.
