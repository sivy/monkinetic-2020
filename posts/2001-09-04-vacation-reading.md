Title: Vacation Reading
layout: post

Ahhhh, vacations are for reading. Jodi and I went out to the beach for the long weekend to hang out with her parents, down from D.C. and renting a beachhouse. On our way we stopped at the library where I got copies of <a href="http://www.cluetrain.org">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> and <a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/henryv/full.html">Henry V</a>. I finished Henry V, and got 2/3 of the way through the Cluetrain. It really is a great book, though not what I was expecting. And Shakespeare... he is truly a master. Jodi and I also read some more of The Hobbit (which she had never read) and I read 2/3 of a 1972 Jack Trevanian <a href="http://www.mostlyfiction.com/spy-thriller/trevanian.htm">spy thriller</a> which was lying around the house.
