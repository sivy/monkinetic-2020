Title: David Sleigh - Festival
layout: post

I finished another project last night with the client - David Sleigh, a friend who is self-releasing his new CD, Festival. No web site, yet, although we got him his domain yesterday. You can see <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/services/portfolio/#folio-1731">some of the work</a> in my portfolio.
