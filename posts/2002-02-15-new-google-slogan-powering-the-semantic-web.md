Title: "New Google Slogan: Powering the Semantic Web?"
layout: post

Glenn Reynolds <a href="http://www.glennf.com/gmblog/archives/00000003.html">writes about</a> the new <a href="http://www.google.com/appliance">Google Search Appliance</a>: &quot;You can also take the raw XML output and work with it, too, which opens up a wide array of possibilities of combining Google&#39;s search output with other intranet or Internet services.&quot;<p>

With my recent interest in the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/categories/semanticweb">Semantic Web</a>, this looks like one could do some really cool stuff with generating RDF. Google has not only become the indispensible tool for this web, it may be the same for the next one.</p>
