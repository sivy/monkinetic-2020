Title: "NPR: Create Once, Publish Everywhere"
layout: post

<blockquote><p>In this series of posts, I will be discussing these philosophies, as well as how NPR applied them and how we were able to do so much with so little (including <a href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">our NPR API</a>).</p>
<p>COPE [Create Once, Publish Everywhere - Ed.] is really a combination of several other closely related sub-philosophies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build content management systems (CMS), not web publishing tools (WPT)</li>
<li>Separate content from display</li>
<li>Ensure content modularity</li>
<li>Ensure content portability</li></ul></blockquote>

<p>Good stuff from NPR, and good reading for anyone building content tools online.</p>
