On the <a href="http://community.scriptmeridian.org/16239">Script Meridian list</a>, Brent expounds on his future:

<blockquote>Some of you have been around long enough to remember that before I worked for UserLand I was an independent developer who was active in the Frontier community. That&#39;s the role to which I&#39;ll return. So I&#39;m not disappearing or anything like that.

In fact, my plan is to participate more in the ScriptMeridian community and help turn it into a great resource for developers, users, and for UserLand. I totally dig the energy on this list lately, and I want to help organize it and keep it going.

Awesome! Thanks Brent!
