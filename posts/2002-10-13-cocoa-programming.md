A new Cocoa book, <a href="http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/">Cocoa Programming</a>, is shipping. Not sure <i>what</i> the deal is with the anemone on the cover though. Authors <a href="http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/AuthorBios.html#scott">Scott Anguish</a>, <a href="http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/AuthorBios.html#Erik">Erik Buck</a>, and <a href="http://www.cocoaprogramming.net/AuthorBios.html#Don">Don Yacktman</a> are serious long-time Cocoa hackers, and the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">aspiring Cocoa jedi</a> would be foolish to ignore their tome.
