Title: Empowered Tech Support
layout: post

My position with <a href="http://www.contentconnections.com">Content Connections</a> is basically tech support / IT with some development thrown in. One thing I love about it is that I&#39;m completely empowered to improve the things that we get complaints over.

We have a page on one of our apps that users often get hung up on - they tend to lose the popup window into which they enter their comments. So I was writing an email to explain it to a user today when a (potentially elegant) solution occured to me. I grabbed my boss and described it to him. He says &quot;you know, I wonder why we didn&#39;t do it that way before? That&#39;s really good. Go for it!&quot;

So now I need to refine it and build it, but it&#39;s so cool that I don&#39;t have to wait for a dev team to get around to releasing a new version of whatever to get changes made. The company trusts me to do what needs to be done.
