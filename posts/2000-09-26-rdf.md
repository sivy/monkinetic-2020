Been looking into <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> again... there&#39;s gotta be an app in there somewhere. A problem I see is that sometimes metadata is used to define <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/back-end-architecture.html">data</a>... something it isn&#39;t equipped to do efficiently. At a later time I may try to backup my statements, but not on the few hours of sleep I&#39;m running on now.
