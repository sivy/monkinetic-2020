From <a href="http://www.groove.net">Groove</a>&#39;s <a href="http://devzone.groove.net">DevZone</a>:

&quot;Some days, the X&#39;s, M&#39;s, and L&#39;s are so deep in the halls it&#39;s tough to find your way to the candy bars. In fact, one of the first questions we ask candidates during job interviews is to spell XML. No spell, no Groove.&quot;

Now THIS is my kind of place! ;-)
