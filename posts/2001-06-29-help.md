Title: Help!

There&#39;s a song I heard on the radio the other day that I cannot for the life of me figure out the title or artist for. I can remember some of the lyrics on the chorus, but that&#39;s it. And I can hear the main hook in my head something fierce. The lyrics go something like (please don&#39;t laugh):<p>

<i>
i try to rise, and<br />
keep my head up (head up)<br />
i&#39;m the king of the kong(?)<br />
we&#39;ll be singing the song<br />
bring it on<br />
bring it on<br />
bring it on</i><p>

Can anyone can help me figure this out?!?</p></p>
