Thanks to two loal Libraries, I am now in possession of three of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392142/qid=1044315251/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-3104707-5991217?v=glance&amp;s=books">Edward</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392118/qid=1044315251/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-3104707-5991217?v=glance&amp;s=books">Tufte</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392126/qid=1044315251/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/002-3104707-5991217?v=glance&amp;s=books">masterful</a> tomes. His books are as interesting as I&#39;d thought they&#39;d be, though still different than I expected. So far I&#39;m most interested in <u>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</u>, the earliest of the three (1983). It may be that this book contains informaiton useful to the understanding and assimilation of the other two. We&#39;ll see.


(At 1983, 1990, and 1997, I believe we can expect another next year. -) )
