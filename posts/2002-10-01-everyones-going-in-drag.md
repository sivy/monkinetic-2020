I agree. Brent&#39;s <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/rssclipboard.php">RSS clipboard format spec</a> looks solid, and will definitely be a useful contribution. <p> I dragged the above quote from NetNewsWire into Blapp, which doesn&#39;t use Brent&#39;s clipboard format (but works for me). My question to Blapp users is this: would it be worthwhile to add support for this?</p></blockquote> (<a href="http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog/2002/09/30#computers/apps/Blapp/blog1">link</a>)

Personally, I think the more the merrier. I was chatting with Jim yesterday and he suggested asking Chimera to support the RSSItem pasteboard format, where the selection on the page would be sent with the drag (along with the title and url that the <code>MozURLType</code> supports) as the <code>rssItemDescription</code>.
