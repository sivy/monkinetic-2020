Title: Peggy Noonan - The Blogs Must Be Crazy
layout: post

Peggy Noonan - <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006302&amp;ojrss=frontpage">The Blogs Must Be Crazy</a>. She makes a ton of good points, for example:

&gt;In newspapers you have to go to the editor, explain to him why the paper should have another piece on the Eason Jordan affair, spend a day reporting it, only to find that all that&#39;s new today is that reporter Michelle Malkin got an interview with Barney Frank. That&#39;s not enough to merit 10 inches of newspaper space, so the Times doesn&#39;t carry what the blogosphere had 24 hours ago. In the old days a lot of interesting information fell off the editing desk in this way. Now it doesn&#39;t.

This is an inspiring article.   Thanks <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/4564">Seth</a>! (Oh, and <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/02/17#When:8:25:44AM">Dave</a> too.)
