Title: Geekery Ahead
layout: post

Ok, I&#39;m going to geek out for a minute here... I&#39;ve been listening to <a href="http://dailysourcecode.com/">Adam Curry&#39;s feed of audio posts</a> today, and noted that he often mentions links to other&#39;s sites on the &quot;show&quot; (he *is* a blogger, after all).

It occured to me that it would be interesting if Adam&#39;s DSC posts included lists of the links he mentioned, as footnotes or something. Then I thought of a better idea: encode the link in the comments field of the mp3 file -- trickier to implement but oh-so-very-cool. Looking ahead, I could see a piece of audio-posting software that would let you drag a link onto it while recording, and it would add the link to the output file&#39;s meta data, perhaps also adding the time the link was inserted:

[hh:mm:ss] Harold Gilchrist, Poolside &lt;http ://radio.weblogs.com/0100368/2004/08/18.html&lt;

Then (again thinking ahead) our media reader/audioblog client would read the list and present it to us so we could follow along while listening. Yeah, that would be *cool*.
