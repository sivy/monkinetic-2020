Title: Local Blogs
layout: post

[Bill](http://bbrown.info) turned me onto a couple new (to me) blogs by a local guy named [Chris Tingom](http://chris.tingom.com/). One is [brainfuel.tv](http://www.brainfuel.tv/), which tends to have a lot of good web design critique and analysis. The other is [Arizona Coffee](http://www.arizona-coffee.com/), a topic near and dear to my heart. (I like to spend time around the corner at Stonegrounds, using their free WiFi to work from &quot;home&quot; :-) ).
