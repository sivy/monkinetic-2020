Title: Bug/Issue Tracking software & OS X
layout: post

If you&#39;re a small developer and have found a bug-tracking or issue-tracking system that you really like, please ping me at steve AT <a href="http://www.contentconnections.com">this site</a>. I&#39;m especially interested if you&#39;re using it in a mainly Mac OS X environment.

I&#39;m assuming something web-based, but am open to whatever may be working for you. Bugzilla is not an option. I&#39;m a multi-purpose support person and I don&#39;t want to install/configure/babysit Bugzilla.

Thanks!
