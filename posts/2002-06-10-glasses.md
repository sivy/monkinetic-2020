Well, I&#39;ve been getting headaches at work lately, and when I go to the movies. After Spider-Man and Star Wars I got serious, nausea-inducing,  eyes-watering, jackhammer headaches.

This weekend I went to see an optomitrist (sp?) to get checked out. I had not had an eye exam since I was 12, so I thought it would be a good thing.

Well, it turns out that I&#39;m slightly far-sighted, so even though my eyes can compensate and I have 20-20 vision, my eyes were working harder than most people&#39;s would to focus on objects at arms length (including books and computer screens).

So... I got a prescription for a very-low-power pair of glasses (+.50 each eye - for comparison most reading glasses start at +1) which I now use when working on the computer (8+ hours/day) or reading. I can already tell a difference in how tired my eyes get. Hopefully this will at elast stop the headaches, and perhaps extend the time I&#39;ll still have in 20-20 land.
