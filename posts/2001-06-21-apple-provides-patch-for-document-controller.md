Title: Apple provides patch for Document Controller
layout: post

Apple is providing a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1039.html">source code patch</a> for applications using Cocoa&#39;s Document Architecture. The functionality will be patched system-wide in a Mac OS X update later on. This is the first time <i>I&#39;ve</i> seen this kind of thing from Apple. Right on.
