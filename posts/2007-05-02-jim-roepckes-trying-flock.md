Title: Jim Roepcke's trying Flock

[This post made using Flock](http://jim.roepcke.com/2007/05/01#item7697)

&gt;I&#39;m trying out <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a>, a cross-platform browser based on Firefox that adds social networking, photo, RSS and blogging features.

&gt;It&#39;s pretty slick, but it&#39;s definitely not ready for prime-time yet.  It crashed on me navigating through some of my RSS feeds, and the UI, while excellent so far, still needs polish and performance tuning.
