title: I'm With Her

I'm speaking as an Ex-Conservative, Ex-Republican who cannot abide what the party has largely become, and has lost affinity with the selfish, neo-libertarian outlook of that party, even before Trump came along. Trump represents the most horrid of personal, professional, and political behaviors and needs to lose by as large a margin as we can muster.

I'm voting for Hillary Clinton for President of the United States, and likely Democrat on most of the down-line races in AZ.
