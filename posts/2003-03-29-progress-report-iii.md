Finally! It&#39;s working, and I get to have a weekend! (I don&#39;t know if I could have stopped if I hadn&#39;t fixed this thing...) But seriously, I am so glad to have this script working. I really hate that admin-type stuff you have to do to get work - writing proposals, doing project plans, timelines, etc... This is going to save me a not-insubstantial amount of time, I&#39;m hoping.

Yes, Mygannt.py has made the transition to outputting PDF. It&#39;s nice. Really nice.

Check out the output <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/files/chart.pdf">here</a>. *Whew*!!

There&#39;s more to do (oh, isn&#39;t there always?) but now I can shower, and eat, and other things normal (read non-obsessed) people do. -)
