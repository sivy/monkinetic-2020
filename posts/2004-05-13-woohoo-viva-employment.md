layout: post

<a href="http://www.mcmains.net/ruminations">Sean McMains</a> (friend and <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com">Conversant</a> user) has been <a href="http://www.mcmains.net/ruminations/2004/03/11#item1029">out of work</a> since March when they closed the office of Electronic Arts where he worked.
&gt; <a href="http://www.mcmains.net/1067">Woohoo!</a>
Just heard from the University, and they extended me an offer! I should be starting on Monday.

Congrats, Sean, and good luck!
