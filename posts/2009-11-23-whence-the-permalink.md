Title: Whence the Permalink?
layout: post

This morning I'm pondering the place of the [permalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink) in the real-time web ecosystem. Twitter, the poster child of the real-time web, [still has them](http://twitter.com/steveivy/status/5975472955), but I wonder about the utility of that link when we've got updates flying off our dashboards as fast as they do.

I suspect that the permalink will actually become *more valuable* as we attempt to actually find that link we missed or that we know someone mentioned recently. As the search engines start to [make use of these real-time streams](http://www.betanews.com/article/Twitter-hooks-up-with-Google-Bing/1256162819), the trick will be making that permalink (possibly hidden behind one or more url shorteners) discoverable again, possibly leveraging [#hashtags](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/), [/tags](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/08/new-microsyntax-for-twitter-three-pointers-and-the-slasher/), and the like.
