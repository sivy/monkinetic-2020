Title: Plugin Test
layout: post

I&#39;m testing a new plugin I&#39;m working on, please be patient.

|bill brown|

|pixel|

|nullgel|

|sir not-appearing-in-this-film|

This plugin works by looking in the post content for bits of text between |&#39;s (vertical bars), then checking to see if that text is in your links database. If it is, it replaces the pipe-text-pipe combo with the text, linked to the URL in your links db. The above links, |bill brown|, |pixel|, and |nullgel|, are all in my blogroll links category, and are therefore linked to their respective sites. Sir not-appearing-in-this-film is not, so the pipes are stripped and the text returned unlinked.

Caveat: for now, the regex I&#39;m using is /|([_a-zA-Z0-9-s]+)|/m, so no punctuation can be used in your link names. I consider this a bug, but have not worked out the regex yet. Grr. :-(
