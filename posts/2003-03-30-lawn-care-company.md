Spec Web Site Design: Design for a local lawn care company. The company has no site currently. In my design I tried to develop a look that was professional yet friendly.

The site design features a searchable resource database of lawn care information and tips, based on the tpe of lawn, the task being performed, etc. Customers looking for winter tips on how much to water their desert landscape, for example.

The site also features a lawn-care weblog where the owner can share news, local tips and tricks to lawn care in the desert (the location of the company), and customer alerts.
