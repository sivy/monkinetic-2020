I&#39;ve spent most of the morning checking in changes to my application here at work. I&#39;ve found a pretty good process that helps me makes sure that the comments that go into CVS represent what has changed in the code.
<ul>
<li>Use CVL to identify changed files.</li>
<li>Open the file in <a href="http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?FileMerge">FileMerge</a> to see the differences between versions.</li>
<li>I have an <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> document for tracking change notes.</li>
<li>I go through the diff in FileMerge, and put my comments in the outline under the filename.</li>
<li>When done, I paste the comments from OmniOutliner into the comments field when checking in the code.</li></ul>
