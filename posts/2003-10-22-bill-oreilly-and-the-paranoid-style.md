Title: Bill O'Reilly and the Paranoid Style
layout: post

I don&#39;t watch Fox News, as I don&#39;t get all the fancy cable channels for my $13/mo. But I&#39;ve followed from a comfortable distance the bruhaha between <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/">Bill &quot;Suitcase Nuke&quot; O&#39;Reilly</a> and <a href="http://www.ohthethingsiknow.com/">Al &quot;Snider-Than-Thou&quot; Franken</a>, as well as the (evidently vivid) on-air blowup between O&#39;Reilly and NPR&#39;s ever-collected <a href="http://freshair.npr.org/">Terry Gross</a>.

On <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/">PressThink</a>, Jay Rosen analyzes why the current media doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; O&#39;Reilly and his volatile style of delivering, and making, the news, and at the same time introduces us to the idea of <a href="http://karws.gso.uri.edu/JFK/conspiracy_theory/the_paranoid_mentality/The_paranoid_style.html">The Paranoid Style</a> of politics (Richard     Hofstadter, 1964).

I don&#39;t really agree with O&#39;Reilly&#39;s style of news, but I can see how it could be downright infuriating to his opponents. It&#39;s hard to get the moral superiority over someone with no shame. Heh.
