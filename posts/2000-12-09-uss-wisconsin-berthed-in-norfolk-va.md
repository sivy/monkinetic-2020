Yesterday, Pearl Harbor Day, the battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin was finally berthed in Norfolk, Va. I can&#39;t wait to go down and see this amazing peice of history. If you can&#39;t make it to Virginia, here are some links:

Remembering what these people did for our country through World War 2, Korea, and other tours is what yesterday was about.

<a href="http://www.pilotonline.com/">Pilot Online</a>: <a href="http://www.pilotonline.com/military/ml1208led.html">&quot;The Wisconsin, the last of the great battleships, bearer of some the most fearsome guns the Navy ever sent to sea, dreadnought, battlewagon, chunk of history, had arrived.&quot;</a>

<a href="http://www.battleshipwisconsin.org/armament.html">Battleship Wisconsin</a> - Armament, Main Gun Battery: &quot;The range of the gun is 23 nautical miles, and the gun shell weighs approximately 2,500 pounds and requires 20 men to handle it.&quot;

I have to say - this is one bad-ass piece of hardware.
