Overall? LEGO is *not* "more expensive than ever before", it just feels like it:

>Now, the dream set is closer to the $400 range. It doesn't mean that LEGO doesn't make sub-$100 sets. They do, and more than ever. It just means that in comparison the $25 set looks a lot smaller than it did when the largest set was only $100. LEGO pricing has become a victim of its own expanding market.
