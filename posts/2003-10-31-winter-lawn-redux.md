Title: Winter Lawn Redux
layout: post

Hehe. I went looking for information again this year on planting a winter lawn (something we have to do in Arizona since the Bermuda that survuves the summer heat can&#39;t survive the cooler winter temps) and discovered that <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/1540">my weblog post</a> from last year is the #2 result on Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=arizona+winter+lawn+&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">arizona winter lawn</a>. Not that it helps, but it was funny.

This year I&#39;m more prepared, with a ton of seed from a neighbor, funky matallic flags to scare off birds, and a line on some cheap cow manure to fertilize with.

Cue James Brown: &quot;Heyehh!! Watch me now!&quot;
