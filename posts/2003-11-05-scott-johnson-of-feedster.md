Title: Scott Johnson of Feedster
layout: post

Right now I&#39;m hacking on a small project involving blogs and news, and so far I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://blogdex.net">Blogdex</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> for my data.

I need some RSS-specific data though, so I contacted Scott Johnson of <a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a>, the RSS search engine. Feedster is already a rocking service, and Scott&#39;s going to look into what it would take to provide the data I need.

w00t! smile
