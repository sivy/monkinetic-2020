layout: post

Wow, I actually had to find out about this from <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/update/archives/week_2003_09_21.html#007278">Lockergnome</a> (Thanks Meryl!) - R.E.M. has a cool mock news site up at <a href="http://www.morningteam.com">morningteam.com</a> promoting their new release, &quot;Bad Day&quot;.

To me, &quot;Bad Day&quot; is a return to the heady political days of <a href="http://www.retroweb.com/rem/lyrics/song_Ignoreland.html">Ignoreland</a>, from Automatic For The People (1992).

<h3>Bad Day</h3>
<p>
A Public service announcement followed me home the other day<br />
I paid it nevermind, go away<br />
It&#39;s so thick you could stir it with a stick<br />
Free teflon whitewashed presidency<br />
We&#39;re sick of being jerked around<br />
(wear it on your sleeve?)
</p>
<p>
broadcast me a joyful noise into the times<br />
Lord, count your blessings<br />
we&#39;re sick of being jerked around<br />
we all fall down
</p>
<p>
have you ever seen the televised<br />
invited sub-committee prize<br />
investigation dance<br />
those ants-in-pants glances<br />
i look behind the eyes<br />
it&#39;s a hallowed, hollow, anesthetized<br />
&quot;save my own ass screw these guys&quot;<br />
smoke-and-mirror lock down
</p>
<p>
broadcast me a joyful noise into the times<br />
Lord, count your blessings<br />
&quot;the papers wouldn&#39;t lie&quot;, i sigh, &quot;not one more&quot;<br />
(it&#39;s been a)<br />
</p>
<p>
...bad day (please don&#39;t take a picture)<br />
it&#39;s been a bad day (please)<br />
it&#39;s been a bad day (please don&#39;t take a picture)<br />
it&#39;s been a bad day (please)
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re dug in deep<br />
the price is steep<br />
the auctioneer is such a creep<br />
the lights went out<br />
the oil ran dry<br />
we blamed it on the other guy<br />
sure all men are created equal<br />
here&#39;s the church - here&#39;s the steeple<br />
please stay tuned we cut to sequel<br />
ashes, ashes we all fall down
</p>
<p>
broadcast me a joyful noise into the times<br />
Lord, count your blessings<br />
ignore the lower field<br />
oh, this means war (it&#39;s been a)
</p>
<p>
...bad day (please don&#39;t take a picture)<br />
it&#39;s been a bad day (please)<br />
it&#39;s been a bad day (please don&#39;t take a picture)<br />
it&#39;s been a bad day (please)
</p>
<p>
(do do do do do oooo...)
</p>
<p>
broadcast me a joyful noise into the times<br />
