Title: Is your blog/site/presentation POSH?
layout: post

<abbr title="Plain Old Semantic HTML"><a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/posh" title="Plain Old Semantic HTML">POSH</a></abbr> is a new acronym/idea sprung from the foreheads of the idle chatterers ([just](http://tantek.com) [kidding](http://adactio.com), [guys](http://factoryjoe.com/blog)!) The idea is to give the idea of semantic (suitably meaningful in the linguistic sense) HTML an easy-to-remember handle.

&gt;The term semantic-html is a mouthful, and belies both how simple it is, how well established it is among modern web designers, and the fact that it has benefits far beyond the obvious doing the right thing for the Web by using semantic markup. We need a simple short mnemonic term that captures the essence of the concept, and is easily verbed (to posh, poshify, poshed up).

I wonder how &quot;Plain&quot; the &quot;Plain&quot; in POSH is?
