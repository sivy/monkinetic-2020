I have to admit that it took me a minute to see why the name of Google&#39;s news product search site, <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle">Froogle</a>, was so apt. &lt;smacks forehead&gt; (via the <a href="http://google.blogspace.com/archives/000756">Google Weblog</a>) Very very cool though!
