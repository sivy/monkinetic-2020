*I'm sick-ish tonight. A headache and lots of tiredness is making blogging slow and groggy*.

We're trying to get [Allaire's](http://www.allaire.com) [JRun](http://www.allaire.com/products/jrun/) working on either Windows NT or Linux. We have a project that we want to use servlets for, and JRun seems to have a good reputation... but man, it's hard to get configured properly. We've gotten 2.3.3 working temporarily, then it stopped. De-install, try 3.0. 3.0 on Linux (Mandrake) is finally installed and sort-of working. The demo servlets run, but only in the default directory - not in any of the other directories the docs say will work. Of course, my test servlet won't run anywhere. *Most frustrating*.

It was very easy to get Suns Java web Server running, and get servlets working, but JWS is very limited, and doesn't run behind IIS, which is a requirement.
