Title: I Need a New Coffee Maker.

For Christmas this year, [the "office"](http://wallrazer.com) will be buying me a new coffee maker. I love my coffee. Like any nerd, caffeine is a staple of my pre-2:30pm routine. However, I do **not**:

* Feel the need to either "simplify" or "purify" my coffee-making "experience" - IE, spend 25 minutes making a contemplatively pure cup of slow-dripped, organically-grown, fertilized-by-unicorns, hand-ground coffee.
* Need a $600 espresso machine with its own water supply, 14-stage carbon filter, and included barista named Pablo.
* Want a machine that requires individually-packaged, multi-flavored "capsules" of coffee to do its job. I have an [excellent coffee shop](http://www.bergiescoffee.com/) that imports and roasts their own beans - daily - a mere 2 miles away.

So, while the [Aeropress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) may be the stuff of coffee purists' dreams, I just want a good-quality automatic coffee maker that can take a reusable filter, and preferably (better yet, optionally) can dispense straight into a cup (I'm sick of coffee pots).

Any recommendations? Ping me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/steveivy) or steveivy at google's email service dot com.
