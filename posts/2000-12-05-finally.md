Title: Finally!!!
layout: post

I&#39;ve been a graphic designer for years, and used Macromedia (previously Aldus) <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/freehand/">Freehand</a> for may of those years. I used Adobe&#39;s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html">Illustrator</a> before and during that time, and I consistently like Freehand better. But...

<a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/illustrator9layers.gif">THIS</a> is something I&#39;ve been waiting for for years. And Adobe did it first. An outline-based layer system where you can explore the contents of grouped and subgrouped graphical elements. IT&#39;S ABOUT TIME! Ok, Macromedia - your turn.

BTW - <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/freehand/productinfo/features/images/layers.gif">this</a> is Freehand 9&#39;s pathetic excuse for a Layers palette.
