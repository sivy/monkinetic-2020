Title: Light Bulbs!
layout: post

One of my alpha testers just emailed me:
<blockquote>A big light bulb just went on in my head about Sid, NetNewsWire Lite, and Conversant. Wow!</blockquote>

Wow indeed! I love when this happened to me, and I&#39;m honored that my app could be a part of that experience for someone else!

Sid does have some great integration with NetNewsWire now with the <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/rssclipboard.php">RSS pasteboard code</a> working. This is what writing for the web is all about IMO - it&#39;s no hypocrisy to use the right tools for the job. I use Sid daily (unless I&#39;ve broken the build) with NNW, and I have all the benefits of working with OS native apps rather than browser-based apps. Spell checking, speed, and cross-app integration are big parts of that.
