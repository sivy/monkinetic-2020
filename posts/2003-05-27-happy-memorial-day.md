Title: Happy Memorial Day!
layout: post

I often forget that Memorial Day was intended for us to remember those who fought, and those who died, for this country in war.

Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyseneca/memorial.htm">quick history</a> of how Memorial Day came to be.

Today I want to honor my grandfather, Marion Richard (&quot;Grandpa&quot;) Ivy, who is NOT dead, and who managed to stay that way in spite of parachuting into France during World War II, being an artilleryman (&quot;cannon cocker&quot;) in Korea, and even managing to do a tour in Vietnam.

Thanks for what you did for our country, Grandpa, and thanks for coming home again so we could spend all those awesome weekends at your house with you and Grandma as we were growing up. I love you.
