Larry Wall, inventor of the perl programming language, <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/06/1343222&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=145">answers questions on Slashdot</a>. One of the most interesting boiled down to:<blockquote>&quot;I remember reading at some point that you are a Christian... Please tell us how in the world a scientific or at least technical mind can believe in God...&quot;</blockquote>

Larry&#39;s answer is beautiful (question and answer #7 at the link above).
