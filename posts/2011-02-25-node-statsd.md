I guess once I get a bee in my bonnet I can't let things go. First, it was [python](https://github.com/sivy/pystatsd), then it was [perl](https://github.com/sivy/statsd-client). After a couple hours effort, I just released [node-statsd](https://github.com/sivy/node-statsd), you guessed it - a StatsD client for node.js.

Now, if I could only get a project to use one or more of these clients.
