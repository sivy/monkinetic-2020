Title: Fighting On Our Knees
layout: post

|Jodi| just posted a great summary of current events and call to prayer for all of our believing friends and family. <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2005/02/17/fighting-on-our-knees">Fighting On Our Knees</a> is a look into the arbitrary workings of the Ukrainian bureaucracy, and the seeming randomness affecting our adoption process. Please join us in prayer!

While I&#39;m at it... this process has been tough. No one promised it wouldn&#39;t be, but nevertheless it&#39;s emotionally, spiritually, and even physically taxing. We have to keep reminding ourselves that God is in control, that he has plan for our lives that is  good, as he is good, and that we can put our hope in him. It&#39;s a daily meditation on who God is and who we are - through our adoption process we are learning how to live life one day at a time. Just like we did during 18 months of <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/07/19/identity-crisis/">unemployment</a>. Sometimes we learn lessons in cycles.
