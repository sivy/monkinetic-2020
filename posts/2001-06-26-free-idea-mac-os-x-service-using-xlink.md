Title: "Free Idea: Mac OS X service using XLink"
layout: post

Ok, thinking about Smart-Tags-done-right again... Here&#39;s a free idea. I&#39;d like to see a Mac OS X service (probably need to be imeplemented in Java) that lets me download libraries of XLinks, then (optionally by using the service) tags words in my documents with a popup menu of possible links. This would build on work done in XLink, make use of existing Java-based <a href="http://www.xlinkit.com:8080/xtoox/">XLink</a> libraries, and be a total opt-in. Everything, of course, that Smart Tags aren&#39;t.
