Title: A Few Of My Favorite Things
layout: post

Jodi got me some of my favorite presents this year. We&#39;re a bit tight, but she found some great gifts!

In case you can&#39;t tell, that&#39;s a &quot;Play Bass Guiter&quot; book with CD, and two bass guitar picks. I&#39;m learning the bass, by the way, and the book will help out a lot! It&#39;s also going to re-introduce me to some of the music theory I&#39;ve worked so hard to forget. -)
