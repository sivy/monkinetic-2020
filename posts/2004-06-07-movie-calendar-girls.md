Title: "Movie: Calendar Girls"

Jodi and I are watching <a href="http://video.movies.go.com/calendargirls/">Calendar Girls</a>, a cute and touching movie about a group of older women in England who decide to pose &quot;semi-clothed&quot; for a charity calendar. It&#39;s cute, but it&#39;s also deeper than I expected. Unlike <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119164/">The Full Monty</a>, which ended on the triumphant note, Calendar Girls follows the women as they deal with the ramifications of their success. Rent it sometime, it&#39;s pretty good!
