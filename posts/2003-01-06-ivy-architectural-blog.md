Title: Ivy Architectural Blog
layout: post

One thing I did not mention in my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/01/04#item1681">last post</a> about the <a href="http://www.ivyarchpc.com/">Ivy Architectural Innovations</a>&#39; site: it has a <a href="http://www.ivyarchpc.com/iaiToday.html">blog</a>!

The owner (my father) mentioned the other day that I&#39;d need to fill him in on the whole idea. He follows this blog regularly (hi Dad!) so it shouldn&#39;t be too hard. -)

I&#39;m excited to see how he and his employees and clients take to it. I believe communication in a personable voice is so vital to building business relationships, and Dad has always had a way with people  - should be cool!
