Title: XFN Test Data
layout: post

I whipped up an [XFN test page](http://deliciouslymeta.com/projects/xfn/test_data.html) with some [XFN](http://gmpg.org/xfn) test data for those developing parsers or other tools. It has all the canonical cases from the [1.1 profile](http://gmpg.org/xfn/11), as well as a variety of common-sense two-relationship combinations, and a basic set of invalid relationships (&gt;1 friendship value, for example).

If this is helpful to you, or you hav ecomments or suggestions, a feedback link is on the test page.
