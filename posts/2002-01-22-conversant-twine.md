Title: Conversant, Twine
layout: post

I <a href="http://support.free-conversant.com/4253">just saw</a> on Conversant&#39;s <a href="http://support.free-conversant.com/">support site</a> that Conversant is not tied directly to Frontier&#39;s object database for storing data. Instead, <a href="http://www.macrobyte.net">Macrobyte</a> has written a database access layer and driver architecture to abstract that away from the groupware app itself. <p>

As I posted <a href="http://support.free-conversant.com/4256">here</a>: &quot;I had no idea that Conversant was so flexible. I
mean, I knew it was *flexible*, I just did not know it was *FLEXIBLE* ;-)&quot;</p>
