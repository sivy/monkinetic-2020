As seen on <a href="http://blogspace.com/swhack/chatlogs/">#swhack</a>:
<pre>
[4:33]  * Morbus runs away.
[4:33]  * Morbus throws handfuls of ferrets in
redmonk&#39;s general direction.
[4:34]  * redmonk targets railgun on Morbus
[4:34]  * redmonk ducks ferrets
[4:34]  * redmonk pulls trigger
[4:34]  * Morbus starts pounding on the jump button
like a lamer.
[4:34]  &lt;redmonk> *whang*!!
[4:34]  * Morbus respawns.
[4:34]  &lt;redmonk> *splutch*
[4:34]  * Morbus respawns again.
[4:34]  &lt;redmonk> now this is the way to play quake
[4:34]  &lt;Morbus> heh.
