layout: post

[Seth Dillingham](http://www.truerwords.net/) is running a [software auction](http://www.truerwords.net/fundraising/pmcsoftware/) in support of the Pan-Mass Challenge:

>Where did all this software come from? It was donated by the authors and companies that publish it. Sixty-nine authors and publishers, from major Mac software companies to well known and influential "indie" developers to little shops you may not yet have heard of.

>They donated all this software for a good cause. Every dollar raised through these auctions will be donated to the <a href="http://www.pmc.org/">Pan-Mass Challenge</a>, which directly supports the <a href="http://www.jimmyfund.org/">Jimmy Fund</a>, for the research and treatment of cancer at <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/" target="Dana-Farber Cancer Institute">Dana-Farber</a>.

[The first auction](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=320148900035&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMESO%3AIT) is up - go bid for some great Mac software, or tell a friend!
