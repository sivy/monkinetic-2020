Title: Skyping The Netherlands
layout: post

I&#39;m on the horn on <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a> (a voice-over-ip softphone)  with <a href="http://www.geekswithblogs.net/jemimus">Robert Kloosterhuis</a> from the Netherlands. Robert is one of the participants in <a href="http://www.kevindevin.com/">Kevin Devin</a>&#39;s Tech Chat podcast, which I listen to religiously, so it&#39;s cool to get to know him a bit better.
