I forgot to link to this a while back, but after looking into it I&#39;m doing so.

<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/macdomeeu/dev/current/mod_rendezvous/">mod_rendezvous</a> is a module for Apache that makes your web server available via Rendezvous. Now, that&#39;s pretty cool, but I just realized that it&#39;s Mac OS X only, I assume because it (logically) uses the OS&#39;s Rendezvous implementation. Fooey. I&#39;m going to be setting up a local Linux server at some point, and was really hoping that this mod would run there.

Now, if only someone would do something interesting with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/rendezvous/">this</a>, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem. -)

Ah, I see that the author is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/macdomeeu/dev/current/mod_rendezvous/">already on the case</a>. Schweet. (Same link as above, look for the FAQ section &quot;Where is the Linux/Unix version?&quot;)
