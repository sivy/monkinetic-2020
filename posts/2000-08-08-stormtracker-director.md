<b>Nate updates his site!</b>

My bud <a href="http://users.erols.com/winesett/">Nate</a> has a great Shockwave <a href="http://users.erols.com/winesett/StormTrackerINSTALL.exe">StormTracker</a> (Windows only). Nate&#39;s a diehard stormwatcher, and Director geek, too. If you love storms, check out Nate&#39;s app - it&#39;s worth it.

Yes, that&#39;s me he&#39;s ribbing on his home page. I&#39;m an XML freak, I can admit it.
