Title: This is another test
layout: post

I&#39;m now testing my ping code for Sid. I have to post here (instead of to my local copy of Conversant) because weblogs.com tried to read the site when you ping. So in order to check that it&#39;s all working I have to post to (and ping for) a site weblogs.com can reach.

Here&#39;s hoping!
