Computer Books. I think I may want the canonical C book, whatever it is. If you know what the canonical C book may be, please let me know. I&#39;ve heard it mentioned before - one of the authors is something like Kearny, or Kearnsey? I can&#39;t remember for the life of me.

Wait - found it. <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0131103628&amp;vm=">The C Programming Language</a>. <i>Kernigan</i> and Richie, or the &quot;K+R&quot; C book.

Of my 355 search results (for &quot;Programming C&quot;) on Fatbrain, the K+R book was the first hit returned. The second hit was <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=DM10004536&amp;vm=">Object-Oriented Programming and the Objective C Programming Language</a>. This is funny, because I&#39;m getting into programming for &quot;Mac OS X&quot;, and this book is Apple&#39;s intro to that environment. I don&#39;t want this one, though, because I can download it <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/ObjectiveC/ObjC.pdf">here</a>. However, if anyone else can suggeest good dead-tree books that will help me, <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">let me know</a>.

Also, I&#39;d like the <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0201633612&amp;vm=">Design Patterns</a> book.
