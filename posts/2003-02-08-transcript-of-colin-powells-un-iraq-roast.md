Title: Transcript of Colin Powell's UN Iraq Roast?
layout: post

In reponse to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/07.html#a2202">this post</a> by Robert Scoble, I&#39;ve been Googling for a transcript of Colin Powell&#39;s remarks to the UN on Feb. 5. Anyone find them yet?

<a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&amp;comment=2202#497">I commented</a> on Robert&#39;s post with an idea: I think there could be a place for a site that takes (or makes) transcripts of public speeches, addresses, etc. of politicians (or anyone, for that matter) and posts them online, with paragraph-level permalinks. This would allow for some cogent analysis of what was said, and allow for some really good discuission where everyone has a common set of facts to work from.

Of course, if something like this exists, someone let me know!
