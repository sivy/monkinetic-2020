Title: South Mountain Kicked My... Again.
layout: post

Ok, so going for a 5 mile trail ride at South Mountain (Desert Classic trail) *seemed* like a really good idea.

Dumb, Steve, real dumb.

That stupid trail kicked my butt. <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/1678">Again</a>. Luckily this time it was sans nausea. -)
