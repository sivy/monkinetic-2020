Title: Stupid Human Trick #337
layout: post

Oy. 2 weeks ago I got a pair of nice rollerblades at a garage sale for $5. I&#39;ve used them like 3 times so far.

Well, we&#39;re hanging out with friends today for Memorial Day, and they live like 2 miles away. So I&#39;m like, &quot;hey, I bet it would be fun to blade over to the Parenteau&#39;s this afternoon!&quot;. Uh huh. 2 miles. In 110&degree; heat. Riiiiight.

Well, I almost made it. I got to within about 1/4 mile when the heat finally got to me - I turned onto our friend&#39;s street and the newly paved blacktop was murderously hot. I was worn out, I sat on the sidewalk, changed into the sandals I had 'binered to my camelbak, and walked the rest of the way.

I told Jodi next time I intended to do something like that to hit me over the head.
