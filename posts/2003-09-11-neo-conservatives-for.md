Title: Neo-Conservatives For...?
layout: post

I have a problem. I consider myself a neo-conservative, generally for fiscal conservatism and moderate on social issues. But I&#39;m sick of Bush.

I don&#39;t think the Bush administration (and I don&#39;t think you can separate Bush and the people he chose to work with him) has been honest about what&#39;s going on in Iraq, and I think the whole War On Terror is a miserable civil-rights-destroying failure.

I supported Bush because he seemed to be supporting my views on smaller government, but there&#39;s been an awful lot of spending coming out of this bunch, a lot of it for things I don&#39;t agree with. (See aforementioned Iraq and WOT fiascos.)

And, most superficially, I honestly can&#39;t stand the way he talks and presents himself. I can&#39;t imagine a speech he hasn&#39;t butchered.

So... who do I support in the next election? I&#39;d rather not throw away my vote &aacute;l&aacute; Nader, and I can&#39;t support <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com">Howard Dean&#39;s platform</a>, no matter the flutter he&#39;s causing in the blogosphere.

So, what to do? If you&#39;re a republican or conservative and not sure what to do in the next election, I&#39;d love to hear about it. You can <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">email me</a> or use the comments link below this entry.
