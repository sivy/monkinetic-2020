I don&#39;t use Apple&#39;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/">iCal</a> much b/c it&#39;s slow. But this nifty little <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kgg/icv.html">alternative viewer</a> for iCal events makes me want to put everything I can think of in iCal, just to watch them crawl inexorably toward &quot;now&quot;. Wheee!
