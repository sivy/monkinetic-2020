Title: All the angst over Atom (Scripting News)
layout: post

[Dave adds Atom 1.0 support to his software](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/09/05/allTheAngstOverAtom.html#disqus_thread). No big deal unless you were around in the tech industry about 7-8 years ago, and were anywhere near the RSS/ATOM flame wars. As one sage said "then again, let's not go there. ['Tis a silly place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfGpVcdqeS0)." Thanks Dave!

PS. Somewhere, some aged Atom proponent is shrieking "we won!" and missing the point completely.
