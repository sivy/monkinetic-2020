Title: Finally, Working History in Sid.
layout: post

Yes, each conversation document in Sid now has a working history. When you post to your site, Sid keeps a copy of the post. You can slide out the history drawer, load a previous post, edit it, and Sid will post the edits to the site, and save them back to the history as well.

I think I&#39;m going to call this feature freeze, and try to work on 1) a better name for Sid, and 2) nice icons. -).

Well, ok, not quite feature freeze. heh. I want to add a button that lets you clear the form if you accidentally load a post to edit, but change your mind.
