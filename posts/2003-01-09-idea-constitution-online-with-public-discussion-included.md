Title: "Idea: Constitution online, with public discussion included"
layout: post

I&#39;m, like sure this is out there somewhere already, but if not, it should be:

The U.S. Constitution, online in sections/paragraphs, etc, so that each bit can be the start of a discussion thread or the target of annotion.

There&#39;s a (possibly useful) set of Supreme Court annotations <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/constitution/">here</a>.

Here&#39;s a good one, <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/toc.html">The Founder&#39;s Constitution</a>. No discussion, but it looks like they have some sort of annotations - it&#39;s not obvious to me what they refer to.

Another - <a href="http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/">FindLaw: Cases and Codes: U.S. Constitution</a>. Searchable and annotated, but no public discussion. That&#39;s important to me.

<a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html">The U.S. Consitution Online</a>. Not bad, but again... no public discussion.

I do like that the Founder&#39;s Consitution has permalinks. Is it really that important to have public discussion? I don&#39;t know. It&#39; seems so to me - or at least, it seems that there should be at least <i>one</i> online copy out there that does.

I did not go past one page at Google - I was just curious. If anyone already knows about a site that offeres public discussion on specific seelections from the U.S. Constitution, I&#39;d love to hear about it.
