Thomas Wilson has started a new weblog related to information technology and theory. The <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/irweblog/">Information Research Weblog</a> is affilliated with the <a href="http://www.informationr.net/ir/&quot;">Information Research journal</a>, and covers information theory, the semantic web, trends in IT, and other related topics. In Tom&#39;s words:<br />

<blockquote>&quot;The purpose of the list is to provide a log of &#39;stuff&#39; of interest to the members. By which I mean references to new articles, books, events, reflection on your own experiences etc., etc. on themes of relevance to Information Research - widely interpreted to include information management, information science, information systems, records management, the Webby end of library management, etc., etc.&quot;</blockquote>

Welcome to the weblog community, Tom!
