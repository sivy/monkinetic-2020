Title: Help! Play Find-The-PDA
layout: post

Last week someone linked me to an image (a mockup) of a possible Apple PDA, featuring pro-mouse-style clear plastics and an OSX-style interface. Now I cannot find the lik to save my life. So- if you know where this elusive pic is, please <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">let me know</a>!
