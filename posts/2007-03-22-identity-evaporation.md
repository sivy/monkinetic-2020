I found [this comment](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~3/103312082/extra_bonus_quote_of_the_day.html) from former President Clinton quite sad:

>I have to be in politics or I will evaporate.

How many of us live our lives that way - our identity inextricably tied to something temporal, even ephemeral. Is there something *you* have to be a part of or you would evaporate?
