Title: TinWhistle (was NewBase60)
layout: post


Apropos of my recent interview with [Tantek &Ccedil;elik](http://tantek.com) about URL shorteners, I've ported his [NewBase60](http://tantek.pbworks.com/NewBase60) code (part of his [CASSIS project](http://tantek.pbworks.com/CassisProject)) to perl. It's now found on github at <http://github.com/sivy/TinWhistle>. This code converts numbers (in this case, dates expressed as days-since-the-epoch) into a base60 (sexagesimal) representation that's *really* short. For example, '1971-06-29' becomes '94', and '2010-05-26' becomes '45v'.

As described in [the interview](http://www.monkinetic.com/2010/05/tantek-celik-diso-20-brass-tacks.html), this value is used in conjunction with some other bits to create a *reversible* short URL - meaning that anyone following the algorithm described in that post should be able to derive the URL from the shortlink, and [not be dependent on a particular service](http://mashable.com/2009/08/09/trim-shuts-down/) to resolve them.

This code is pretty complete and converts from DateTime to days-since-epoch, ordinal dates (YYYY-DDD, see the readme), and sexagesimal days.


### Update

I've expanded the code and moved it to a [new project name](http://github.com/sivy/TinWhistle). I've implemented a URL shortener called TinWhistle (roughly based on Tantek's [Whistle](http://tantek.pbworks.com/Whistle)) that uses NewBase60, and of which NewBase60 is now a sub-component.
