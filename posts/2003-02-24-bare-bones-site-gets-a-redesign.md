Title: Bare Bones site gets a redesign
layout: post

Oooh, cool! I haven&#39;t been to the BareBones website recently, but I went tonight looking for a BBEdit glossary for <a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a>, and found out they&#39;ve done a <a href="http://www.barebones.com/">redesign</a>! Very very nice. Good job guys!
