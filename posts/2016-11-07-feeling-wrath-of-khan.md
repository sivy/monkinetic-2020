[Elizabeth Bonesteel](https://twitter.com/liz_monster) tweeted about Star Trek: Into Darkness, to which I will not link, nor which will I discuss right now:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yâ€™all got me thinking again about ST: INTO DARKNESS, &amp; I realize I went into that one already annoyed.</p>&mdash; Elizabeth Bonesteel (@liz_monster) <a href="https://twitter.com/liz_monster/status/795762490701447168">November 7, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But it got me thinking about why [Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/) was so epically fantastic for me. I'm having Real Feels right now just thinking about it.

I was 11 when Khan came out, so I didn't see it in theaters. I had watched much of the original series in syndication with my family, and I was in my late teens when I finally saw Wrath of Khan.

I don't have the time or skill for a proper exposition right now, but some bullet points on why WoK still inspires some deep emotion for me:

- Khan is charismatic, cut like a boss, and leads a Mad-Max-style horde of 80s bad-asses. What's not to love?
- For the love of God, ***Ceti eels***. I'm cringing in terror *right now*.
- ***THIS IS Ceti Alpha V!!***
- The movie exposes many of Kirk's character flaws, the real pain he causes, and *does not excuse them by the end.* That's bold film-making right there, especially in the 80s when everything had a happy ending.
- Kirk's consummate self-assurance that he's done the Right Thing, without ever looking in life's Rear View Mirror, is cuttingly White Male thinking.
- And he more or less *doesn't get away with it*. His thoughtless hubris costs him friends and subordinates, and by the end, costs him his deepest relationship.
- Spock's *real death*. I know that the ending was tweaked to show the torpedo tube intact, but as a teen in the 80s who did not yet know the Ways of Hollywood, that was *pretty f'ing permanent*.

Sorry I need to go have a cry.
