Title: HDK Cycles

I found out that the bike shop I went to for years (1988 - 1996, when I stopped riding frequently) has a <a href="http://www.hdkcycles.com/">website</a>. These guys are really knowledgeable. I&#39;m looking for a shop closer to my neighborhood, but if I don&#39;t find one, I&#39;m making these guys my shop of choice once again.
