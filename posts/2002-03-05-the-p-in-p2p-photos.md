Title: "The P in P2P: Photos"
layout: post

<a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/02/28.html#a1273">John Robb wants a P2P photo app</a>:
<blockquote>Sharing photos is still too hard.  I can send photos via e-mail or post a couple to the Web, but I can&#39;t easily share whole albums with friends and family.  What I want is a desktop content management system that lets me organize my photos into albums using a browser interface.  I then would like to share these albums with friends and family using P2P.</blockquote>

John wants a browser app, instead I think I would want something more like <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>. Why have a desktop app without a desktop interface, especially with something as WYSIWYG as working with digital photography? iPhoto already has several ways to &quot;share&quot; your pictures - a plugin could be written for iPhoto that would P2P-enable the app. Now, that *would* be cool.
