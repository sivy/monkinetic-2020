Title: Getting in shape
layout: post

Once upon a time I was a really good rock climber. My friends and I would be at the rock gym twice a week, and be <a href="http://outingclub.wlu.edu/guidebook/climb/ravensroost/ravensroost.htm">up in the Appalachians</a> climbing on weekends when the weather allowed.<p>

Fast forward 6 years, and I&#39;ve been programming web apps for a while, got myself <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net">married</a> at some point, and have basically turned to mush. We&#39;ve moved out to Phoenix, Arizona, and I&#39;m betting there&#39;s some good rock out here somewhere.<p>

So I&#39;ve devised a simple starting regimen of exercise, just to get me to the point where I can go to the rock gym without making a <i>complete</i> fool of myself. This week&#39;s goals: 15 situps, 10 pushups, and (I am such a wuss) 7 pullups - daily, morning and night. I have got to remind my body that it used to be capable of some pretty amazing things - I know I can get back there.</p></p>
