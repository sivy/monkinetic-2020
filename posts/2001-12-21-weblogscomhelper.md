I find this very frustrating, and I think Dave is being unfair to those bloggers who have to ping <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a> themselves. And it&#39;s unfair that Dave can make sure the blogs <i>he</i> likes are updated on weblogs.com. <p>

Basically Dave took the crawler out of weblogs.com, then added it back, but only for the sites *he* likes. Grrr.</p></p>
