He asked me to come up with a header design that combined Penn State&#39;s logo with something for Mac OS X.

Following PSU&#39;s fairly rigid usage requirements for &quot;The Mark&quot;, I worked up a design that looked good and provided a solid theme to work from. Clark was very happy with the outcome.
