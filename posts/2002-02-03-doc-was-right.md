Title: Doc was right
layout: post

Doc Searls <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/02/01#anotherCoxSuckerStory">said</a> &quot;And if nothing else works, unplug your cable modem for an hour or two. It&#39;s a piss-on-a-spark plug solution, but it works.&quot;<p>
Well, we unplugged the cable modem last night, and the linksys just to be sure, and plugged it all back in 12 hours later. Sure enough, I got online first time, and have had no hiccups yet (knock on wood). <i>Thanks Doc!</i></p>
