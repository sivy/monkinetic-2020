Title: Finally! Back to the future on Monkinetic
layout: post

I&#39;ve finally got my archives imported into WordPress. It took 3 months of piddling aroud with php, and more knowledge about mysql backups and hacking than I wanted, but it&#39;s done. Now I get to do the same for <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net">Jodi</a>&#39;s site. Fun! :-)
