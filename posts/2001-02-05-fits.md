Finally Napster-ized some Fury In The Slaughterhouse, after a couple years failing to find them in CD stores. They&#39;ve done some great tunes. In their own words:

&quot;It sounds a little bit like R.E.M., and a little bit like Sting... <br />
Na na na naaa, All in all, we&#39;re just brilliant thieves&quot;
