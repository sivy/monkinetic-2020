Title: Why are WebObjects classes so expensive?
layout: post

<a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Aaron Hillegass, Cocoa Deity and WOGod</a>, via the Mac OS X Dev list, on why OS X/WebObjects classes are expensive:<p>

&gt;Here is the math: An experienced Cocoa/WebObjects engineer bills around $150/hr,  so 60 hours of instruction is $9000.  Half the price of the class typically goes to the room, equipment, and marketing people.  So figure the class costs $18,000.  Thus,  you can never charge $200 for the class.

I guess not! $3500 for the class doesn&#39;t look so bad anymore.</p>
