This will be my last post on http://redmonk.editthispage.com/.

I finally got Redmonk.Net hosted on a server with a content management system on the backend, hosted by <a href="http://www.macrobyteresources.com/">Macrobyte Resources</a>, on their <a href="http://www.macrobyteresources.com/conversant/">Conversant</a> internet groupware application.

Many thanks to &quot;Dave&quot; and Co. at &quot;UserLand&quot; for hosting Redmonk.Net all this time. Manila&#39;s features have made my weblogging life wonderfully easy.

So why move to Conversant?

Conversant is an amazing, powerful application. It is, truly, more than a content management system. But it is also, truly, a <i>great</i> content management system. The depth of features provided by Seth Dillingham and crew is astounding. I&#39;ve been using it for two weeks now and I&#39;m still discovering how powerful this application is.

Yes, I&#39;m gushing. Deal with it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;

So, today I roll out the new <a href="http://www.redmonk.net"><b>Redmonk.Net</b></a>, complete with it&#39;s <i>proper</i> url, new look and feel, and new features. <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">Come on over</a>!
