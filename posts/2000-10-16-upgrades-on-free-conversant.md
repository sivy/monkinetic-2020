Title: Upgrades on Free-Conversant
layout: post

&quot;Seth&quot; and crew at &quot;Macrobyte&quot; (<a href="http://www.turtleprod.com/greg/index">Greg Pierce</a> is fingered as the person most responsible ;-)) have given Conversant some <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/free-conversant/support/1558">nifty upgrades</a>, including the ability to set the MIME type for individual pages, even more message macros, an awesome new search page, and a weblog speed boost.

The new search page has made my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/recentRedmonk.rss">RSS page url</a> even simpler. The array of admin tools for that page alone dwarfs the advanced prefs for some other CMSes.

Greg, You Da Man!
