Daneba has Carbonized their Canvas drawing program. I&#39;m installing it now. Macromedia&#39;s port of FreeHand sucks. IT&#39;s slow and of questionable usefulness. Adobe is MIA. So far Canvas (which I just launched) seems fast. I&#39;ve heard for some time that Canvas had some really powerful features. Looks good so far.
