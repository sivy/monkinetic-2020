[Scotch egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_egg):

&gt;A Scotch egg is a snack food of Scottish origin consisting of a cold, hard-boiled egg removed from its shell, wrapped in a sausage meat mixture, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. It is eaten cold, typically with salad and pickles.

I used to have these at the [Whitehorse Pub](http://www.whitehorsepub.com/A-home.html) at Pembroke Mall, in Virginia Beach. From their menu:

&gt; Boiled Eggs, encased in Pork Sausage, breaded, deep fried and served with White Horse Mustard.
