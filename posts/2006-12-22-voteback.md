Title: VoteBack
layout: post

I&#39;ve been hacking on a Wordpress implementation of VoteLinks - one that actually discovers if the incoming link contains a vote in the form of a <code>rev</code> attribute with one of the vote-link values: <code>vote-for</code> <code>vote-abstain</code> or <code>vote-against</code>.

My implementation is currently based on modifications of <code>pingback\_ping()</code>, <strike>and <code>wp-trackback.php</code>,</strike> and a custom plugin called VoteBack. VoteBack uses can discover if an incoming pingback came from a link containing a VoteLink, and it recognizes incoming Trackbacks with a <code>votelink=vote-*</code> key=value pair.

###Update (01/02/2007)

Based on feedback on the [trac issue](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3491), I&#39;ve changed [the plugin](http://deliciouslymeta.com/projects/vote-links/voteback_2_0_4.zip) to not use the custom <code>trackback\_extend_comment</code> hook, instead checking <code>$\_POST</code> for the info right in <code>preprocess\_comment</code>. Included is the modified xmlrpc.php that patches <code>pingback\_ping</code> you&#39;ll need to grab the extra data from the pingback.

Also, hopefully the pingback link data will be added to $commentdata so that <code>pingback\_extend\_comment</code> will go away as well.

###Technical Details

To make this less hack-dependent, several new hooks will need to be added to WordPress. I&#39;ve implemented the plugin as a filter on a new hook, &#39;pingback\_link&#39;.

<code>$extended\_data = apply\_filters(&#39;pingback\_link&#39;, array($link\_anchor, array()));</code>

The VoteBack plugin parses the link anchor (the complete anchor tag for the pingback-discovered incoming link) for the vote and if found, it adds a &#39;votelink&#39;=&gt;&#39;thevote&#39; pair to the array that was passed in, then returns it. Afterwards, <code>$extended_data</code> is merged with $commentdata and is then passed to <code>wp\_new\_comment()</code>.

Within <code>wp\_new\_comment()</code>, WordPress applies the &#39;preprocess\_comment&#39; filter, so VoteBack adds a filter on &#39;preprocess\_comment&#39; and if the comment data contains a &#39;comment\_vote&#39; key it modifies the title of the comment (really the author&#39;s name right now) and adds &quot; (Agreeing)&quot; or &quot;( Disagreeing)&quot;. Rudimentary, but functional.

For a demo see the first comment on: [Votelinks+Trackback=VoteBack?](http://redmonk.net/archives/2006/12/20/votelinks-trackback-voteback/)

###What&#39;s needed

As far as I can tell, two entry points are needed: one for plugins to access trackback info (including any exteneded values that have been sent) before it&#39;s posted as a comment, and one for plugins to process the pingback link and modify the commentdata based on what they find.

These are rough ideas and I hope that some will look at them and provide suggestions for improvements. I&#39;m not going to release the code quite yet, but you can link to any post on this site now and if you include a vote-link, your agreement or disagreement will be noted in the posted comment.

###Try It Out
* [VoteBack experimental plugin](http://deliciouslymeta.com/projects/vote-links/voteback_2_0_4.zip) (with fixes)
* Wordpress [Trac issue](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3491) with patches for xmlrpc.php and wp-trackback.php that add hooks <code>trackback\_extend\_comment</code> and <code>pingback\_extend_comment</code>.
