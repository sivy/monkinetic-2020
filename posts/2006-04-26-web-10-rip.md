Title: "Web 1.0: RIP"
layout: post

This morning a coworker was commenting on how cool it was that [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) includes functionality that will compress their JavaScript library by converting all human-readable javascript to short identifiers made up of underscores and numbers or letters (&quot;_a&quot;,&quot;_1&quot;, etc). Compression births [obfuscation](http://www.answers.com/obfuscation).

All I could think of was all those hours, days, perhaps weeks I&#39;ve spent viewing the source code of web pages that did cool stuff - stuff I wanted to learn how to build. Web 2.0 may be about open source backends and wizzy front-ends, but in the midst of it all I miss the simplicity and excitement of the [Web-that-was](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_in_fiction#Firefly).
