Apple&#39;s new image management software, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>, is really, really, cool. <p>

Weird typographic moment: the letters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;P&quot; look really good next to each other. Mmmmm, type.<p>

Anyway, I created an album of pics from our recent XBOX blowout (9 guys and two XBOXes and HALO), and used iPhoto to push them to my iTools homepage... but iPhoto never told me where it put them! I&#39;m trying to log into iTools now to go find them, but Apple&#39;s servers are getting pounded. If anyone else has found where iPhoto puts our pics, <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net?subject=iPhoto">let me know</a>.</p></p>
