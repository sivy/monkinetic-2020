layout: post

Wired has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html">totally cool article</a> on the special effects in the new <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com">Matrix films</a>, and how Gaeta and crew are stretching the limits of how realistic CG is done. Awesome! I cannot wait for this movie. May 15!!!!
