Title: New Comments View
layout: post

I&#39;ve made some changes to the site here - I&#39;ve had feedback from some people that the discussion group view was a bit intimidating, so I&#39;ve implemented a Radio-comments style comments interface.

<a href="&lt;!--#siteurl--&gt;comments.html$msgnum=&lt;!--#msgnum--&gt;" onclick="openComments(&lt;!--#msgnum--&gt;);return false;">Click here</a> to see this message and any comments in the new view.

I&#39;m open to, um, <i>comments</i> on the new interface. smile
