Title: Web-App CMS's reviewed by BBC
layout: post

The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/easyweb/print.shtml">BBC reviewed</a> several free website Content Management Systems including <a href="http://www.editthispage.com">Editthispage.com</a>, <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com">Free-Conversant</a>, and <a href="http://www.wikiweb.com/">WikiWeb.com</a>.

<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/19">Dave says</a> &quot;It&#39;s impossible to get through to EditThisPage.Com&quot;. (Ed:This has been edited out since this was posted)

I say, then head over to <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com">Free-Conversant.com</a> for an experience with a great system, a dynamite support staff, and super-responsive programmers. Feature requests welcomed.

(Although my site is hosted on F-C, I am not an employee of <a href="http://macrobyteresources.com">Macrobyte</a>, nor do I play one on TV. )
