[Designing an open Facebook alternative (outline)](https://jfm.carcosa.net/blog/computing/facebook-alternative-outline/), Jason F. McBrayer.

> I meant to be writing a couple of blog posts on [Mastodon](http:/joinmastodon.org). But a thread on Mastodon led me to start thinking about Mastodon:Twitter::X:Facebook. There have been a few alternatives that haven’t really gone anywhere, which is kind of unfortunate, but perhaps they were just too early. And I was thinking about what we’d want today.

(I need about 3 hours to process and comment on this, so go read it and think amongst yourselves)
