##Sound And Fury: A Cross Cultural Crisis

###Introduction

In watching Sound and Fury, I found myself often perplexed and frustrated at the inability of participants on either side of the debate to really engage the other in a way that did not degenerate into frustration, anger, or superiority. Part of the problem seemed to be attitudes of exclusivity on both sides that simply antagonized the other.

I know that this is not a simple &quot;intra-family&quot; struggle. It&#39;s a struggle between two cultures to make sense of a paradigm-changing technology. The ability to *significantly* improve a deaf person&#39;s hearing through surgery raises questions that are being vigorously debated in both the Deaf and hearing communities. These debates, captured in microcosm in *Sound and Fury*, are handicapped by the tensions of two cultures meeting head-on.
