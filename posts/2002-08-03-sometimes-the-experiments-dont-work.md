Title: Sometimes the experiments don't work
layout: post

Those who know me know I&#39;m a bit of an experimentalist in the kitchen. This evening while trying to find something interesting to put in an omelet, I tried some Indian <a href="http://www.picklenet.com/sections/cats/recipes/world/indgin.htm">ginger pickle</a>. Now I admit this was an odd combination, but you have to admit, you never know unless you try, right?

Well, the verdict came back quickly, and the foreman was not pleased! Ugh! Not one of my better ideas. -)
