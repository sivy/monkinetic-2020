Title: This is my world
layout: post

I just got rocked by the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20000416100333/http://redmonk.editthispage.com/):

&gt;###This is my world

&gt;via [Scripting News](http://www.scripting.com/): [Megnut](http://www.megnut.com/) - &quot;Web people can tell you the first site they ever saw, they can tell you the moment they knew: This, This Is It, I Will Do This.&quot;

&gt;###And I am

&gt;I was sitting in the studio at [Ethicom](http://www.ethi.com/) in early 1994, and I had gotten Ethicom signed up with [InfiNet](http://www.infi.net/). I used [Mosaic](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html), on a Mac. Unlike Meg, perhaps, I don&#39;t remember the first web page I went to, but I knew then that, as Meg says, &quot;I Will Do This&quot;. It was another year and a half before I get my wish, and I dragged several designers kicking and screaming into the world of the 216 palette, HTML, etc. We beta-tested the first versions of [GoLive](http://www.adobe.com/products/golive/main.html), we used [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/), and my world was rocked.

&gt;###The World Leader Pretend

&gt;It&#39;s still rocking today.

(That, by the way, is from a post in 2000 on my editthispage site.)
