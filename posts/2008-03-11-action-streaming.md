Title: Action Streaming
layout: post

In another frenetic burst of coding, the prolific Stephen Weber ported MT's [Action Streams](http://plugins.movabletype.org/action-streams/) plugin [to PHP](http://groups.google.com/group/diso-project/browse_thread/thread/9b9612e7214270a1), then to Wordpress. Examples:

* [Stephen's action stream](http://singpolyma.net/#actionstream)
* [My action stream](http://redmonk.net/more_monkinetic/action_stream) ([pretty picture](http://flickr.com/photos/redmonk/2324628580/))
* [Pras Sarkar's action stream](http://headphono.us/)

It uses the same YAML config that the MT plugin does, witha few caveats, but this is an awesome start!
