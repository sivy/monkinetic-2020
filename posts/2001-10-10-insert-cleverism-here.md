Title: Insert Cleverism Here
layout: post

I&#39;m really tired, and the above title will have to do. Suggestions can be sent <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net?subject=a%20cleverism">here</a>.<p>

I got word today from one of my new co-workers about what my first projects are going to be once I get to PHX. It looks like I&#39;m going to get to work on some exciting stuff. Not everything cool out there happens outside the corporate firewall.

<p>There are things going on at U-Haul&#39;s WebHouse that will never be seen outside, but that are making life easier for, and empowering, real people. Now *that&#39;s* what this is all about.</p></p>
