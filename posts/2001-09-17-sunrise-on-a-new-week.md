Title: Sunrise on a new week
layout: post

The drive in this morning was beautiful. As the days get shorter my morning drive has come closer to dawn. This morning the sunrise was amazing - the air was clear and crisp, the sunlight stretching itself over downtown Portsmouth was warm and bright. Nice way to start the week.
