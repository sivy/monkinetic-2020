Title: Springtime in Phoenix
layout: post

Heh. Spring starts in February here in the Southwest. Since mostly you see cacti and desert shrubs, I thought these flowering trees across the street from the Webhouse were awesome. Reminds me of Virginia.<p>

This is the webhouse from across the street. It&#39;s a two-story place in the middle of a bunch of high-rise office buildings - kinda funny. But it&#39;s a kicking place to work, no complaints there. ;-)<p>
