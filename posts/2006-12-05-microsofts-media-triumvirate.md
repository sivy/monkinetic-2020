Title: Microsoft's Media Triumvirate
layout: post

With Microsoft&#39;s release of the [Zune](http://www.zune.net/en-US/), the Mac internet is going nuts explaining why the Zune is a broken, inferior product to Apple&#39;s [iPod](http://apple.com/ipod/). And at first glance I have to agree with them. But my cynicism is tingling, and I don&#39;t think that Microsoft intended the Zune to start out as a viable iPod competitor. Instead, the Zune is part of a strategic [triumvirate](http://www.google.com/search?q=define:+triumvirate) intended to make the iPod irrelevant on Windows. This strategy is composed of Windows, the XBox, the Zune, and, playing the part of the One Ring: XBox Live Marketplace.

(Note: I seem to suffer from a pathological need to do a depth-first traversal of any idea, which usually means I&#39;m down in the weeds around the time I lose interest in writing on a topic, so I never publish. Instead, I&#39;m going to try and skim this idea as fast as possible, and I&#39;ll revisit it later if more needs saying.)

Posit: Microsoft is a platform company. No product needs to be perfect on day one if it has the support of a powerful platform for which it is the only solution. It takes an ecosystem. (see Internet Explorer.)

Posit: Microsoft thinks ahead. Far ahead. They see that the iPod has brand cach&eacute;, but the thing that makes that brand succeed is the media platform: the iTunes Store runnig on Windows, most importantly. So they need that media/commerce platform.

Posit: The [XBox](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/) (in original and shiny 360 flavors) has established itself as a dominant player in the console market. If you look at consoles these days, they are not the game machines of our fathers. They are powerful, specialized (and getting less-so) PCs. The XBox 360 is Microsoft&#39;s Media PC, one where it owns hardware and software.

Posit: Xbox Live set the standard for console gaming online. Sony has it&#39;s own version for the PS3, and I&#39;m pretty sure Nintendo has something like it for the Wii. Microsoft recently launched the [XBox 360 Live Marketplace](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/), where gamers can purchase not only games, but movies and TV shows as well that can be viewed on the user&#39;s television.

Posit: Soon Microsoft will be launching [Live Anywhere](http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/10/microsoft-blends-platform-lines-with-live-anywhere/) which brings that marketplace to Windows Vista and Windows Mobile.

Posit: Microsoft has a [marketplace](http://www.zune.net/en-us/meetzune/zunemarketplace.htm) for the Zune, and [some are suggesting](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/2006/11/03/zune-xbox-live-integration.aspx) that the Zune Marketplace uses XBox live as the backend.

To sum up: Microsoft is building a network of devices that connect to (read: eventually will require) some version of XBox Live Marketplace for sharing (read: purchasing) content. The Zune&#39;s wireless support will grow the ability to wirelessly connect to this marketplace, Windows will be connected, and the XBox (the new Media PC) is connected.

Microsoft&#39;s goal is to OWN their customers&#39; media experience (and media $$$), and if the iPod on Windows is an early casualty of that battle, then no one in Redmond will be weeping.
